# Tiamo Pastoor

## Optional To-Do

* Header maybe **DIFFERENT** between homepage and any other page.
* IDEA (to improve the "Tiamo Pastoor" part): My name, but with letters replaced by typical writing icons (books, feather, pen, something fantasy)
* RELATED POSTS: Use the *logline* of books or a very short summary to fill it up a bit more? Show the *date* or *main category*?
* Change footer image: replace sheep, no thick line.
* Arthur / Is dit het dan? => Slecht opgemaakt, waarschijnlijk, check
* (Potential for comments: something like <https://cusdis.com/> => free for 100 approved comments per month)
