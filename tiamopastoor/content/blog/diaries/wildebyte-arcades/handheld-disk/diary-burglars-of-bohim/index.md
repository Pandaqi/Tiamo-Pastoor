Welcome to my writing diary for the book [Burglars of Bohim](/books/wildebyte-arcades/handheld-disk/burglars-of-bohim/), the 9th book of the Wildebyte Arcades. In this article, I keep track of my progress, my thoughts, any problems I faced, and how I solved them. Hopefully it's interesting or instructive to read!

As usual, **SPOILERS!** for everything in this book. (And even some of the stories before it. Plus some ideas/plots that ended up not even making it in the book.)

## What's the idea?
### Cookie Clicker
I _generally_ try to sort the books based on the complexity of the game you're playing. This isn't a perfect sort and I've moved books around for better story or progression, but I do want to move the "simplest mobile games" to the front.

Also, when the series started, I introduced the character Cookie Clicker and their relationship with Sweettooth. Well, there aren't many games more _simple_ than clicking a cookie and seeing a number go up!

So this felt like the right time to write that story.

Such a simple game, however, obviously doesn't have much to say in terms of story. It's just clicking a cookie. Again and again. A number gets higher. How would that be interesting?

Now, such games are a general category of **idle games**. And the more popular ones do _loads_ of other stuff. They have great graphics, many more buttons to press, you're slowly building a business or factory, etcetera. But ... it's still pressing a button and seeing a number go up (and perhaps a fixed animation play). How does that turn into _story_?

When I planned this book, some time ago, I already brainstormed possible solutions. This actually led to the creation of several _board games_ as I realized interesting ways to enhance this idea.

### Making it more interesting
Namely, by moving it to the slightly expanded version: "You need to click _the right thing_ to get points." 

{{% remark %}}
In the board games, of course, it's about tapping/grabbing the right thing by thinking more quickly than the opponents.
{{% /remark %}}

For an extremely basic example, let's say there are multiple cookies in the game and they move around. You must be quick and precise with your taps, because only the Green Cookies _give_ you points, while the Red Cookies make you _lose_ points.

We can go further. Which cookie is "good" _changes_ all the time, it's not just Green. Perhaps there are rules on the screen:
* "Good Cookies are either Blue or Yellow."
* "Bad Cookies have at least 5 crumbs."

By now, the Cookie theme is stretched too far. If things are moving around, we need to actually have _things that move around_. Like robots, animals, humans.

### The final version
Which brought me to the game idea that seemed promising enough to put this story in the Handheld Disk.
* There's a city filled with beings of some kind. (Not humans perse.)
* It generates random (simple) rules that predict who will become a criminal.
* You have X seconds to _find these specific people_ based on those rules and tap them.
* Otherwise, they succeed in their act.

There are existing games that are similar to this idea, I haven't necessarily invented it :p It's more like I was trying to find the implementation of a general idea that worked best for story purposes.

The last question is: then why is there a _Cookie Clicker_ character? And why can they also just jump around games? 

With each book, I basically have the decision to _explain the game at the start_ or _change/explore the game as we go along_. In this one, I decided to use the second option: the rules I just stated are _unknown_ at the start. Because this actually tied things together.
* Cookie Clicker was the _original game_, but then they updated it to this new version.
* In the new version, as stated, beings are "tapped" which means they're shot down/killed in the game.
* Because Cookie Clicker has no idea what's happening and sees beings dying left and right, they are justifiably upset and call Wildebyte to research the situation.

{{% remark %}}
Having the game be KNOWN right from Chapter 1 is usually the best option if the game itself is simple and nothing special, and the story idea I have is much stronger. I mean, I can't "explore" the game of Flappy Bird for 10+ chapters. You see it for one second, you know 100% of how it works. 

In all other cases, exploration as you go is more interesting. Even if the reader knows the exact game I'm parodying, they might still be guessing at the start as that information slowly unfolds.

## Turning that into story
### The lesson and computer part
With such a simple game, the lesson always had to be about simplicity. But I already mentioned that "simpler is better" in book 3, because it _is_ incredibly important. Instead of just repeating that, we dive deeper.

What does simplicity _mean_ exactly? 
* It means the core actions you repeat all game are simple and intuitive (which you understand by now if you've read the previous books), and all lead to your objective in pretty direct ways.
* You can add _loads_ of rules, variations, content etcetera on top without losing that simplicity---as long as you don't touch the core.
* (And, as the previous book showed, the ONLY exception is to make a game that's just so _inherently fun/interesting to humans_ that they're willing to do some homework to understand and play it.)

To "show" this in a story, we have to let Wildebyte make this mistake. 
* The game receives more and more buttons to press and numbers going up over time. Wildebyte constantly fears this makes it too complicated, but it doesn't happen.
* But then he starts to make changes too, and suddenly the game _is_ too complicated. That's when he realizes he modified that _core game loop_ and steered it away from the objective.

We'll put all of that into a **Detective** or **Murder Mystery** story:

> Several very important members of this game have died, and they don't know how or why.

Cookie Clicker brings Wildebyte into their game to help figure out who did it. Because this game does have a _very strong sense_ of "justice", thanks to its mechanics. 

(So Wildebyte is like: "Sure, I'll find them, but then what? How will it help?" And they are all like: "How will it help? It's JUSTICE! VENGEANCE! That's the reward!" Or something like that.)

The **computer part** handled in this game is just ... **numbers and buttons/clicking**. I'll try to drop small tidbits of info or potential issues with these two elements you'll find in basically all games. And the only two elements you need for Cookie Clicker.

### The general structure
I want to add one funny Detective character.

* They're a parody on True Crime podcasts or typical detective leads in novels.
* They constantly focus on the _wrong_ details.
* They go into long monologues with weirdly specific descriptions of those unimportant details.
* They record all of their notes on a voice recorder.
* (These recordings constantly mention a Curious Cookie, one of his main suspects that he's followed for a looong time. Near the end of the story, this turns out to be Cookie Clicker, and so we've just subtly given that character a backstory/origin story :p)

This character will lead the way. Though with twists, to spice it up.

As usual, I group longer stories into a few smaller stories, to make it more manageable and keep good pace. Let's see what those might be.

* **Chapters 1--6**: WB+ST arrive, meet the Detective, explore the game. A near-death for ST, who is way too loose and careless again.
	* **Goal:** investigate the deaths, visit some important places, follow clues
	* **Ending:** another death. The reveal the game used to be different (we meet many more cookies?), some change into the game because some numbers are now high enough. They discover a huge wall/monument showing properties and realize they match what Sweettooth looks like exactly.
* **Chapters 7--12**: They continue their investigation. The numbers in the game grow higher and they stumble upon even more buttons and numbers. That's how they realize more of how the game works. 
	* **Goal:** investigate further. Wildebyte fears the game grows too complex and wants to work against it, but realizes to his surprise it's fine.
	* **Also:** One button is _unclickable_; and it's exactly the one they need, as it's an upgrade that gives a better view of the city and what happens inside buildings.
	* **Ending:** the _detective_ dies; from now on, they must work with his recordings only. They discover that _everything_ in the game is clickable and tracks a counter. (Just before this moment, though, we have a nice moment where Wildebyte learned better investigative skills from him and thanks him.)
	* **Also:** reset the Clicky_Number to something negative now.
* **Chapters 13--18**: They research how to make that button _clickable_ again, as they try to click as many buttons themselves. They, however, didn't realize many of the buttons are _bad_ (based on more randomized rules) and accidentally move many counters _backwards_.
	* **Goal:** upgrade the game further and use those results to get final answers on the investigation.
	* **Ending:** they now realize 100% of the game's rules, and thus know that criminals are coming to kill Cookie Clicker and Sweettooth and they must shoot them before it happens (based on rules). => "The perpetrator, it seems, was the Player."
	* **Also:** Wildebyte _hears_ the Detective talk about a Lost Memory (he's pretty sure, not explicitly stated of course) in the recordings, and now has to chase down the one who matches the description to grab it. => This is what causes them to actually change the CORE rules of the game, making it confusing that Player and entities don't know what to do anymore.
	* **Also:** Wildebyte also messes with code to press a number "infinite times" ... then discovers infinity doesn't exist and the integer OVERFLOWS, flipping it negative. This flips the entire game upside down; e.g. it's suddenly nighttime (really hard to see who to shoot!) and the appearance + rules shifted suddenly.
* **Chapters 19--24**: A somewhat long climax.
	* **Goal:** Cookie Clicker and Sweettooth stay together, anxiously running away from their impending death, with the task of finding the being holding Wildebyte's Lost Memory. Wildebyte themselves try to reach the gun and control who it shoots.
	* **Ending:** After tense moments, Wildebyte must make a decision---and they end up shooting the right one.
	* (Sweettooth has corrupted Wildebyte slightly more again ... but he himself also grows a bit more human over time, actually fearing for his life.)

Okay, this is a bit more than a very concise chunk outline. But that's fine, my brain was just coming up with lots of good stuff. Now I have a clear picture of the entire book from start to finish. 

The one vague thing, actually, is the murder investigation itself. I'd need to add few more beings by name and have them talk/do things, so they can become suspects. 

And is it satisfying when the resolution is that the Player did it, because that's just how the game works? Or will that feel like cheating? I'm not sure, we'll see how it feels once the actual story is in place.

## Chapters 1--6 (Chunk 1)
This is a bit of a weird one.

Due to circumstances, I had to take a long break between writing this diary and vague outline, and actually starting the story. At least 4 months.

This meant I had forgotten all about how I set up this book, while the rest of the series (until book 20) had actually solidified into a more concrete planning.

This story felt a bit meh. It's just hard to turn Cookie Clicker into a full story, without overcomplicating it or falling back on "tropes" I already used in earlier stories.

At the same time, this _was_ the best place to put it, and I really could not move it around or alter it significantly anymore. The plan until book 20 is already in the agenda, those books already have titles + descriptions, and I like most of that (so I don't want to change it).

As such, I decided to just cast these doubts aside and write this book as I intended.

The first chapter or two, I felt like the concept was _too strange_. Cookies that are alive? They all tap themselves or each other to make a number go higher? Will I already lose all potential readers here?

Once I got going, however, this settled down. I realized why I chose this, I realized my general outline was quite good, and the plot moved a bit more smoothly. I'll probably need to go back and edit those first two chapters, because they feel a bit slow and "weird", but otherwise it's fine.

I also _nearly_ forgot that Sweettooth was in this story too and that every 5th chapter in a book (so 5, 10, 15, ...) is from his perspective :p 

I come up with these general restrictions or guidelines to _help me_ make decisions. So even though it might feel like I'm making my own life difficult for no reason, having such a simple rule (chapter 5 must be told by Sweettooth) helps _immensely_ with making decisions for where to move the plot. Because most ideas just can't be done or won't work with that rule.

From earlier books, I learned that I should _re-introduce_ the general idea of the Wildebyte Arcades in the first few chapters. I think I did that quite well here. I found a few natural spots to devote a single paragraph to mentioning his parents are here too, or that the Mixware Researchers put him here. Not all of it will be terribly relevant in this story, but at least I have the option to use those references now. (Or to create mysteries for readers to find out in other books.)

This also made me re-introduce the Slug from book 6. (Now in a different form, of course.) Instead of inventing _new characters_, I really try to _re-use_ them more. It creates a more cohesive series as a whole and makes it more likely readers want to check out other installments. 

I also did so because I struggled to introduce "suspects" for this murder case. Because it all happens inside a game, many usual suspects (from family ties, from a past life, etcetera) just aren't relevant. Detective/crime stories that just move through a grocery list of new suspects each time, also never felt that interesting to me. ("Oh they must have done it! Oh no, they say their NEIGHBOR must have done it! Oh no, the neighbor says they have a nephew with a gun, they must have done it!" Meh.)

As such, I decided to twist the story to naturally consider _the actual main characters_ as suspects. The first few chapters you are introduced to Cooky Clicker, the detective, that Slug that now looks like a grandma. They are your characters, they perform actions and move the plot forward, so it feels very efficient to have _them_ be suspicious and considered as suspects over time.

This means the murder investigation doesn't actually kick off until after chapter 6 (next chunk), but I was fine with that. 

In a way, this first chunk really "establishes the world". Only at the end of chapter 6 do we get two clear main goals that will be the meat of the story. (I hope. I am optimistic, but the reality of writing often throws curveballs.)
* They have reason to believe the Big Red Button will do something useful for them if pressed. They also know what it needs (a high number of Clicky Points) and they understand the game enough to get those.
* They know how the killer picks suspects and what trails it leaves, which gives them their way into a proper investigation.

I still think this is one of the "weirder" stories in terms of structure and setup. But that's fine. If all else fails, it will just be a mediocre entry into the Wildebyte Arcades. Most likely, I will find the real meat of the story as I finish it and can give the start a facelift during the revision.

## Chapters 7--12 (Chunk 2)
As stated, in these chapters we just progress towards those two main goals. Get loads of points to push that red button; close in on a killer.

This is when different people from the core cast of characters take turns becoming suspicious and being investigated :p

When the climax rolls around, I wanted a slightly bigger "twist" than chunk 1. The reveal that actually _everything_ is clickable and has a counter in the game was a good step. This would even make _buildings_ possible suspects and ups the ante for the story again.

Pressing that Big Red Button might also have worked as an "exciting midpoint" for the story, but I decided it was too early. If I'd given away what it does right then, I'd need to find _another_ goal for the next chunk, and that would overcomplicate the plot.

Instead, they press it, but it fails. So I can setup the actual "educational" part of this book which is about how games register clicks and allow pressing a button.

The "dilemma" of Sweettooth here is an example of things that come to you as a reward for _just writing the story_ and trying to _specify your plot_. Once I finished chapter 6, which revealed that the game predicts who is most likely to perform a crime and kills them in advance, I realized this was a really strong obstacle for Sweettooth. 

He lives and breathes crime and bad habits, because he literally isn't a human and has no morals. But the game will try to _kill him_ on demand, and he has no defense against it, if he thinks about crime too much. He always has to stay "less of a criminal" than others in the game. While his entire life's goal is to be a pirate _and_ turn Wildebyte into one too.

This actually gave Sweettooth something to do and a very interesting perspective in his chapters.

But, yeah, still a pretty odd plot and odd book. I feel like I'm starting the more game-related things too late now, as they have been shoved to chunk 3 almost completely. (The explanation of how numbers are saved, how things check for clickability, the actual rules of this game.)

We just write it anyway, and we'll see.

After a _very_ slow start, this part of the writing process somehow became blazing fast. I finished the entire first half of the book in three days. Perhaps that's because of my attitude of "this book is allowed to suck, just get it done". Perhaps I'm writing garbage. Or perhaps, having even more experience and having written even more books, I _am_ getting better at plotting on the fly.

I strongly feel that the book ideas after this one are far better and have more potential. But I also know that this is a general feeling that all artists have, all the time, because that shiny new idea is always more enticing than the current pile of work you're wading through. So I ignore that and just focus on finishing _this_ book as well as I can.

## Chapters 13--18 (Chunk 3)

As usual, I work on _half_ a Wildebyte book for a week, then jump to _something else_ the next week. This way, I get a nice 7-day break slap bang in the middle of the first draft, and can let my brain generate new ideas (or potential problems to solve) with the book.

Before leaving, though, I always clean up my notes and get the general outline down. That's a general principle I'd always recommend. The hardest part of any work is _starting_, so if the notes are clean and the first line of the next chapter is already written, you're basically already past the hurdle and productivity is smooth sailing.

In doing so, I already had most of chunk 3 (and some of chunk 4) specified quite a lot.

In this part,
* We finally find the perpetrator (by the end)
* We finally learn the specifics of numbers and how games check if something is "clicked", so Wildebyte can finally click that Big Red Button.
* Wildebyte finally listens to the Detective's recordings and gets solid clues as to his Lost Memory and parents.
* And Sweettooth is trying to come back in Wildebyte's favor.

These are clear goals that I simply break into steps, and we move forward one or two steps every chapter.

I also tried to keep these chapters a bit shorter. This book is growing too unwieldy. Nothing too bad, but I really want to keep 40,000 words as a nice maximum for Wildebyte stories. And the middle is the place where stories usually drag the most, so simply writing chapters _slightly shorter_ is a great way to combat that and keep pace.

A few things fell into place here.

A few things are still wishy-washy and will need to be fixed during the revision.

In general, I still don't know what this story is really about and think I'm writing nonsense. But at least it's nonsense that's almost 100% done now :p

{{% remark %}}
In reality, it's usually fine in most spots, with just some glaring errors or muddy parts that a revision has to fix. But when you're coming up with the story, when you're putting down thousands of words a day with 30 different ideas in your head, it always feels like it's a mess and you're not making the right decisions.
{{% /remark %}}

Anyway, not much else to say about this part. I was finally able to get in those technical explanations needed, while keeping them "storified" and tangible. I also was finally able to streamline the detective investigation by actually closing any open threads or uninvestigated suspects.

As I said before, I like murder mysteries, and therefore wanted to try one here. But I don't necessarily like some of the clichés in them. The "neat" formula of having all your suspects introduced, getting them in one place, interrogating them one by one. 

It's much easier to write, yes. I noticed that in one of these chapters. If you can just ask direct questions and the other person answers half and is suspiciously quiet about the others, well, there's a scene with tension, mystery, and questions for the reader.

But it's also boring. One or two is fine, but after that it becomes repetitive and unrealistic. There are so many dialogue scenes you can write with a back-and-forth interrogation, no matter how interesting you make it, before they all become the same.

Anyway, that's over now. The story revealed that the Player was just playing the (upgraded version of the) game and controlling the Big Hand. They were just playing the game.

And now they've pressed that Big Red Button and changed the game for the worse.

The only real change to the plan was that I introduced a _timer_ and the idea that you _have to shoot the right person, or the game ends/resets_.

The timer adds urgency. Without it, why would they need to shoot _now_?

And if shooting the wrong thing was also "fine"---the game doesn't end, you just get no points---then it also ruins some of the tension and narrative.

## Chapters 19--24 (Chunk 4)
I quickly made the decision to have _two_ "epilogues". In all Wildebyte books before now, the main conflict was resolved in the _second to last chapter_ (usually 23), and the _last chapter_ was used to tie off loose ends, reflect on what they'd done, and pick a new game.

But sustaining that tension of "shoot the right person" for 5 entire chapters? And then resolving a large number of loose ends in a single short epilogue? That wasn't going to work.

Instead, I roughly planned the sequence to take 4 chapters.
1. Wildebyte takes stock of the situation, learns Crooky Clicker's method for getting rich ("the roads are also tapped, all the time, which gives them huge numbers"). They try to get all numbers up again, because now they're all _negative_ and making the game unplayable.
2. Sweettooth's chapter => he enters the fray (he's currently the gun's target) and realizes he must do something _good_ to get off that list. He ends up chasing Wildebyte's Lost Memory/parents for them.
3. Wildebyte gets their Lost Memory and views it, which temporarily distracts them and removes them from play. The others keep tapping while also searching for the person that matches the features on the wall now.
4. Just in time, Wildebyte takes control of the gun, closes his eyes, makes a decision, shoots. (The Camera enters as well, which would force him to follow code and ruin his plans, but Sweettooth does something new and _slashes the Camera_. Which crashes and reboots the device.)

I felt like this could sustain the tension all the time, with reasonable steps forward each time. If it took any longer, it would just remove tension entirely. The reader would feel like the gunshot could come any moment ... but it doesn't come ... and it still doesn't come ... until they just don't care anymore and try to read on. 

With this method, the danger stays prevalent for just long enough, and then I must pull the trigger as the writer. (Literally and figuratively.) Not doing so, not having them shoot something, would be incredibly unsatisfying.

Then, the final two chapters are an amalgamation of notes about things "left over" and overall story threads (through all Wildebyte books) to continue.
* Grandma and Crooky Clicker leave again, and explain some more.
* Some message about Layla and her real life, some things about how the game continues and where Wildebyte's parents might have gone.
* Sweettooth talks to Wildebyte and convinces them that it's "us against Ludra" and they should stick together and fight everything.
* Until they, for the first time, say _no_ to the Memory Police and grow defiant.

Hopefully you can see why I wanted _two chapters_ for this, as it's just too many different things to force into a single final chapter.

Even so, I tried to keep it brief. Nobody likes a story that should've ended but keeps tacking on more paragraphs that dryly answer some questions the reader probably didn't have. 

For example, I introduce one Cookie in this book that is nothing more than a suspect. They're there, but they don't do anything else and have no specific scene or interrogation. Is that a "loose thread"? I don't think so. They were never set up to be important, the reader probably never wanted their backstory or "where are they now", so I think it's best to just _leave it_.

## Conclusion
Well, if you read this far, the conclusion won't surprise you. A bit of a weird book. A very unique story that seemed to go off the rails many times, but I think I salvaged it just enough.

In the end, I've learned to suppress these doubts and hesitations. My brain simply wants to write _more stories_, and that necessitates giving up some quality or certainty. In the end, I think the Wildebyte Arcades will have 30 books, and, well, some will be better than others. Some will have wider appeal and a more streamlined story, some won't. 

I try to see that variety as a good and natural thing. If I forced myself to stick to formulas for writing, or keep my stories extremely streamlined and predictable, then I'd be so bored and demotivated that a book like this would never finish. And the Wildebyte Arcades wouldn't even exist!

Also, as I mentioned, I usually come across as quite negative about my books. I _know_ others enjoy them. I _know_ they're better than that. But it's just the perfectionist (and hyperactive) brain of an artist who also sees all the flaws, and _knows_ all the ideas I didn't use and chances I missed.

I think the story is fine. Unique, but not too weird. A few challenging concepts, but nothing that completely stumps any reader.

And I've learned to just write the idea as best as I can, in about 2 weeks time, and accept that. In a few months, I'll do the revision. (Which fixes a few crucial mistakes, and otherwise has notes on what to improve. When writing you always end up saying stuff in chapter 15 that isn't set up yet, but will be once you edit a few paragraphs in chapter 5.) 

Until the next diary,
