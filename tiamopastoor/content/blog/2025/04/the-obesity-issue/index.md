The past 6+ months I've read multiple newspapers a day. Why? Because I wanted to stop eating behind my desk or behind a screen. Instead, whenever I eat something, I _go away_ from my workspace. I grab a newspaper and move to the kitchen or even our garden table (if weather permits), and eat while reading the news.

In doing so, I noticed a pattern. Every single week there would be _multiple_ articles talking about obesity, or our declining health in general. I've read the mantra "eat less, exercise more" _so many times_ the past six months.

But I read all of them. Because it's a large issue that's especially interesting to me because of my chronic illness. It's a _systemic_ issue, and frequent readers know how much I love to talk about that! My decision to stop eating while working was made to _prevent_ getting overweight myself, so there's a bit of irony to reading those articles in the papers now.

This article will give my thoughts about the three different news articles I encountered in the papers.

* The raw statistics about it, and possibly how to interpret them.
* Possible methods for solving this, which mostly comes down to lifestyle and exercise advice.
* People saying we should stop fat shaming and make the world more accessible to overweight people.

And then I'll end the article talking about my own personal problems with eating (too much) and how these news articles influenced me.

## The Statistics

I'm still surprised whenever I read the statistics. About half of all people in the Netherlands are overweight. They predict this to be (at least) 2/3 by 2050. America has already been at that point for a while. The Netherlands is doing _relatively_ well in terms of exercise, probably thanks to our cycling culture.

Whenever I see that, I start wondering. Do I _really_ see so many overweight people? Do I really see a single overweight person for every non-overweight person? No, I don't. When I present these statistics to others, they often agree and can't believe them.

This felt like a perfect opportunity to show, again, the danger of misinterpreting statistics. Or, the other way around, the danger of relying on personal experience to _invent_ some belief about statistics.

When we do this "test", we dig into our memories looking for overweight people. We think about the last five times we went on the road and the people we saw then. This is unlikely to yield 50% overweight people. In fact, this morning I went for a run, and I saw only a handful of other people who were all fit and lean. 

But the statistic isn't wrong---our perception is simply biased.

Most people move around in a relatively small space. We are _mostly_ surrounded by the same people, by our friends and family, every day. As such, if your environment simply doesn't match the average statistic, then you will never see it in effect! You will only see it when you move somewhere else or there's a drastic change in your daily routine. 

{{% example %}}
Remember how I just told you about my 100% fit people encounters while running? Yeah, not really that strange, given that most of them _were also running_.
{{% /example %}}

Similarly, we have to consider the habits of overweight people. They are obviously _less_ likely to exercise, to go outside, to go for a walk in the park. There's an element of lack of mobility, yes, but also an element of shame. In your average trip to the supermarket, or even your average television show, you're simply not going to encounter many overweight people. This skews our perception even more.

And then we have the danger of familiarity and habituation. What _is_ overweight? If you asked people a hundred years ago, their barrier would be far lower than it is today. If you grow up around many overweight people, your perception of what is "too much fat" changes. You start to see someone with an unhealthy appetite as "normal" or "within reasonable boundaries". I'm sure I encounter many people who are _technically_ overweight, but I don't register them as such, because I've seen loads of people comfortable with their belly by now.

Our definition of "overweight" isn't perfect, of course. Anyone with a BMI (Body Mass Index) above 25 is classified as overweight, and above 30 is obese. We can all point at outliers, such as a really muscular man that's technically overweight. But this definition is quite good for 99% of the cases. It's not "too strict": you will only be counted as overweight if you really _are_.

So yes, based on all the other statistics and evidence I can see, this number is correct. About half of the people here are overweight. This is reducing their lifespan, their mobility, their health. It also puts an immense strain on society.

But when you ask someone about this, they are likely to brush it off. We don't _perceive_ it to be that way. Both fit and obese people will give the same response: "that can't be true!"

But it is. It's a typical example of how any statistic relies on _loads_ of different factors. Most people only encounter _one_ factor, such as their environment and how it barely changes, and can never reliably see the statistic. That's why we need science and hard numbers, calculations without bias.

## How to solve this?

In the introduction I called this a _systemic issue_. Fortunately, this is one of the few areas in society where this is understood! The obesity problem is one of the few problems where people _know_ it's not as simple as "just eat less duh". One of the few situations where everyone understands the health of humans is a _system_ and you need to consider everything that goes into it.

For example, 

* I read an article talking about how "stress" makes us more likely to impulse buy unhealthy food.
* Or how unhealthy food is often cheaper, so those with less income have no choice.
* Or how humans tied a _lot_ of social or cultural behavior to food (such as dining together, eating three meals a day, etcetera)
* Or how children are forced by the educational system to sit on a chair 8 hours every day. (And as most people know by now, sitting is the new smoking.)

In recent years, scientific research has also made a dent in common ideas about health. 

For example, studies show that our bodies largely intend to burn the same number of calories each day. If you exercise more ... your body will simply do less the rest of the day. I've experienced this myself numerous times. If I exercise long and hard in the morning, I am far less productive the rest of the day. In a way, I'm trading "productivity in my mental work" for "productivity in my physical health".

If you eat more, your body either stores it as fat, or tries to use all those extra calories. This isn't necessarily good. It can make you so restless you can't sleep. It can cause your immune system to overreact to everything, creating more sickness and infections than otherwise. 

{{% remark %}}
In truth, excess fat _is_ an infection sustained by eating too many calories, but I don't want to get too technical here.
{{% /remark %}}

As such, exercising more does not fully solve the problem, nor does eating less.

I held this misconception for far too long. During my teenage years, I exercised _a lot_. And, because of that, I felt like I could eat whatever I wanted. And yes, this wasn't a major issue, because I was still fit and burning a lot of calories. But it was still _an_ issue. I was always eating too much. I was eating unhealthy food instead of supporting my body. 

And as I got older, and lost some of the time/energy to exercise that much, those eating habits _became_ a major issue. I was still eating whatever I wanted, but not using most of it. My body still expected all those calories, making it _really hard_ to say no to that.

So no, the first step is always to do BOTH. 

> You exercise for your health, you consider your diet for your weight.

### Exercise

If I do a short run in the morning, I feel more energized and can focus more easily on my work. I am _more_ productive. I feel _better_ and have fewer doubts about my creative projects. My body obviously functions and looks better when it's fit enough to run 5 kilometers at good speed.

But the amount of extra calories burned is negligible. When I tried running far longer or faster, I didn't really lose weight, but I _was_ too tired to do much work afterwards. (And because I'd run for longer, I was convinced I could eat more food again, so I think I actually gained weight ... while running nearly 10km a day.)

Most of our calories are used for our _brains_ and for maintaining our _muscles_. Our brains are always active and a huge power hog. Our muscles store most of our energy---to be expended when using the muscle, of course---and take up the rest of your intake. So the best way to lose weight, without considering what you eat yet, is to grow your muscles (resistance training) and to use your brain more intensely (instead of shutting it off or staying within your comfort zone).

There are days when I do research for a Saga of Life story, forgetting to exercise, and I'm absolutely dead tired at the end of the day. Just reading article after article, researching facts about history and biology, making connections, writing down new ideas, trying to solve the major challenge of turning that into an engaging plot (for a story) ... it's such a hard challenge for my brain that it drains way more calories than exercise.

### Diet

But okay, you now have a habit of exercising (resistance _and_ stamina). As I explained, you're probably much fitter and healthier, but _not_ necessarily losing weight.

What now? The obvious answer is "eat less" or "eat fewer calories". More specifically, it's recommended to exercise "portion control". This literally means that you plan your portions and make sure you eat exactly what you need, and nothing else.

This isn't really useful, though. In the Netherlands, for example, we live in a world where piles of tasty food are within arm's reach at all times. Our entire body is made to _eat_ and to be _rewarded for finding food_. As such, all the discipline in the world isn't enough to say no to all of it. Even people with the funds and time to cook healthy dinners _struggle_ here. Because any time we see food, our brain screams we want to eat it. And in our current society, we see (unhealthy, calorie-filled) food _all the darn time_.

I have tried, like so many, to control my portions. It's just not going to happen. 

If you've followed me for a while, you know that I have an incredible work ethic and discipline. Writing dozens of books a year, creating dozens of games a year, maintaining all these websites---it surely doesn't happen because of "motivation" or "luck" :p But even I struggle immensely to control my food intake. To say no when someone bought a bag of crisps and wants to share it. To say no when I'm at a birthday and cake is offered.

The research also shows that _intermittent fasting_ is functionally the same as _portion control_. It amounts to roughly the same calorie intake and response from your body. 

I would still recommend the first one over the second one, though. Because it is _far easier_ to tell yourself "I eat between X and Y; I don't eat any other time of day", than to exercise precise portion control _every single time you eat_. It's easier to make a habit out of eating once a day, or only eating in the morning, than to rely on restraint and discipline whenever you eat, all the time.

I basically switched to intermittent fasting on accident. All my life, I'd eaten _all day long_, and it just wasn't great. I was distracted by the thought "food? let's eat food? now?" all day. My dentist was complaining. I _was_ noticeably getting fatter.

So I just stopped doing that. I told myself I'd only eat in the afternoon, and never outside of that. I only later learned that this was a thing called "intermittent fasting".

I thought it was impossible---it actually turned out quite easy to do. All my life, I had been told that you needed to eat regularly. I was basically forced to take my "three meals a day", forced to eat my lunch at school. But it just wasn't true. We function absolutely fine on eating once in a while, as long as we simply _eat enough (of the right things)_. This accidental switch helped me so much during the covid pandemic. 

{{% remark %}}
Why the "afternoon"? Because at the time, I was still living at home and forced by my mother to attend dinner. So, by picking the afternoon, I could eat dinner without ruining the fasting. I would recommend most people simply pick the morning for eating. Like this: just after waking up, you exercise, you eat, you start the rest of your day.

But this isn't the end of the story. There are some more misconceptions, or things working against us.

**Saturation Suppression:** Lots of food has added components that suppress your saturation signal. This food is literally designed to keep you eating more and buying more, because you keep being hungry. 

Sugar, for example, does this. That's why people can keep eating and eating sugary things, because it suppresses the signal that tells our body that we're full.

As such, a good way to stop eating too much is to stop buying such food. It is _good_ to feel full after eating something. Buy the things that achieve that, which usually means staying away from sugar or superficially added components.

Which leads me to ...

**Fat isn't bad:** Some time ago, lots of food started producing "0% fat" packages and such, promoting them as if they were the best thing for your health ever. Many people, including me and my parents, believed this was _good_. Surely, if we want to be less fat, we should eat less fat! 

It's not that simple. People generally speak of good fat (saturated) and bad fat (unsaturated). Just how we have good grains (whole) and bad grains (basically any other version).

Our body _wants_ food. It needs it. You should absolutely eat some fat food, as long as it's the right kind. Because it will actually make you feel saturated quickly. You will eat one bowl of yoghurt (with, say, 5% fat) instead of three bowls of yoghurt (with 0% fat version). 

Many people have pointed out this "contradiction" and I have noticed it myself. Lots of food that markets itself as being healthy (and 0% fat is the worst offender here) isn't bad on its own, but it makes you eat _more of it_ because it's less fulfilling. Which, as a whole, makes it bad.

Which finally leads me to ...

**Fat vs Energy:** Your body basically has to decide all the time if it wants to use calories for energy immediately, or store them as fat. Some people seem to be able to eat "whatever they want" and never get fat, and we usually say those people have a "quick metabolism". They simply turn almost everything they eat into energy to use, instead of fat to store. How your body balances this is _mostly_ decided by your genes.

This is why most diets don't work or are actually bad for you. When you suddenly start eating way fewer calories, your body goes into panic mode. You disrupted the balance. It fears that food has become more scarce, and thus, as a fail-safe, starts storing _more of it as fat_ (and releasing less of it as energy). 

Compare it to finances. Normally, you might save only 5% of your income in some reserve, and spend the rest of it immediately on things you want. This is a healthy balance between living _now_ and preparing for the _future_. Then you suddenly get fired (or switch jobs, or the economy collapses) and your income drastically lowers. You're likely to change that balance, aren't you? Depending on the type of person you are, you either save more ( = store more fat) or spend it all ( = have no reserves left at all). Both of which aren't great for the future.

If you want to start eating less, you want to do it in small steps, combined with gradual increase in exercise.

### Other factors

Yes, exercise and diet are still the most important aspects. But they are all heavily influenced by the rest of your system.

It is hard to actually achieve the things I mentioned above when you're feeling bad. When you're not sleeping well, or hungover, or stressed about something, or unhappy in general. 

Believe me, I know. I've been permanently unhappy for basically 10 years now. It is _really hard_ to forbid yourself from eating all that tasty food when you're feeling bad about everything and lack the energy to do your work.

As such, I think this deserves equal attention. It's almost useless to try and control your portions when you're permanently stressed. You will just override your discipline every single time to eat whatever you want.

This is, of course, an area that's far too large to enumerate here. I'll just mention some common causes.

* Alcohol is remarkably similar to sugar in its effects. So yes, drinking more will lead you to eat more than you need.
* If you don't sleep well, you are more likely to make bad decisions in general, which includes eating unhealthy food or too much of it.
* Do all your shopping _offline_. It takes more effort, it takes walking around, which means you're unlikely to buy too much food (or stuff in general).
* Similarly, before you go grocery shopping, make a precise _list_ of all you need. Buy that, nothing else.
* Food is a shortcut to dopamine. To prevent reaching for food, make sure you derive some pleasure or satisfaction from _other_ things during the day.
* Food is also a shortcut for energy. To prevent reaching for it, make sure other parts of your life don't drain energy---and, preferably, _give_ energy.

## Should we respect fat people?

Things brings me to the final part of this article. The thing that surprised me the most in all those news articles. So many times, they interviewed obese people and allowed them to make their case. They gave examples of how society disrespects fat people, how it's not accessible to them, how it shames them. They created all sorts of organizations to force laws or policies to change, or at least to make people change their mind.

From what I've seen in the newspapers, the number of fat people claiming they should be respected for being fat is _far higher_ than the number of people actually giving advice and trying to make people healthy again.

Because their most common argument is: "Over half the population is overweight. Isn't it silly, then, to design things for people with less weight?"

This, of course, is not an argument. Unfortunately, I see this _all the time_. The argument of "look at the current situation---we must adapt!"

The fact that there's a problem means you must _solve it_. It doesn't mean you must assume the problem is just "how it's supposed to be" and ask people to go around it, accepting it as the new normal. In fact, we _arrived_ at this situation because of many bad decisions, so these problems always have easy solutions too: undo the bad decisions.

{{% remark %}}
Other examples of this include "well the climate is getting hotter, so let's stop squabbling and just accept the new normal" or "well money and greedy capitalism is how the world works, so let's just accept that we are screwed over every day by ultra-rich companies"
{{% /remark %}}

It is never an argument to point at how something _is_, currently, and say "it is how it is, you must accept it". If it were, my country would currently still be under Nazi rule.

Let me state, first, that I never cared for "respect" or anything. It's a meaningless subjective term, merely abused to force people to shut up instead of hearing criticism. If you ask ten people what "respecting fat people" means, they'll all give different opposing answers.

But if you _do_ want to talk in such terms, then I propose we keep "disrespecting" fat people. Because it provides an incentive to stop the problem. As long as seats are only designed for _reasonable weight_, people will have a constant reminder to perhaps work on their health. As long as doors are wide enough for anyone of _reasonable size_, it will incentivize overweight people to be conscious of it.

The very best way to solve a systemic problem, is to design an environment---the rules of the game, if you will---to incentivize _solving the problem_. The best way to stop humans from becoming overweight, is to _allow_ all the disadvantages that come with it to exist. To make them _worse_, if needed. If you want people to be healthy, then they should be rewarded for being healthy. 

Instead, catering to overweight people would reward unhealthy people for being unhealthy. The exact opposite of what you want in any system. Even worse, it would potentially _punish_ healthy people for being healthy.

### The airplane seats example

For example, take airplane seats. Currently, overweight people have to pay for two seats. Because, well, they literally don't fit in a single one. Several organizations are trying to get them to create bigger (single) seats in airplanes instead. What would be the effect of that?

* Planes can carry fewer passengers, meaning it's far less lucrative, meaning the price of tickets shoots through the roof.
* Overweight people are rewarded for being overweight by paying less than they otherwise would have.
* While everyone else is punished for being healthy by paying more than they otherwise would have.

Not a great idea.

But even this single example can get much worse. Research indicates that the extra average weight of humans has _massively_ increased fuel consumption (in airplanes). It is thus already a factor in raised ticket prices, as well as worsening climate change. If you want to be really pedantic about it, overweight people have already been ruining it for everyone for a while.

Many people don't know this, but weight and fuel consumption in airplanes is a big deal. Before each flight, pilots have to calculate the absolute _minimum_ fuel they need to reach their destination. Because the more they take, the heavier they are, the more fuel they need to fly, and it becomes an endless expensive cycle. Many airplanes are filled with fuel tanks, and redistributing the fuel is necessary for distributing the weight for a good takeoff or landing. 

Some aviation catastrophes have been linked to the airplane being just _slightly_ overweight, perhaps because some passengers sneaked on extra luggage. It's never the only factor, of course, but it's one that exaggerates other problems.

Don't ask why I know all of this. Let's just say I went down an airplane/pilot/famous aircraft disaster rabbit hole :p

### Systems, systems, systems

As a game developer, I obviously think in systems all the time. It's how I approach most of these problems. This might seem silly to others, but it's proven valid every single time I tried. 

{{% example %}}
As you read this article, for example, imagine making a (board) game out of this. Just imagine it. Trying to create a board game where you simulate a society, including buying and eating, including getting overweight (or just health in general). Perhaps a board game about running an airport! See how long you can design rules that allow and even reward bad health before things get ugly, and the game either stalls or stops being fun.
{{% /example %}}

The only way to get a fair and functioning system, is if it's balanced and rewards people doing the right things. If it's not balanced, the system will inevitably spiral out of control until it blows up. It people are not rewarded for doing the right things, they will not do them.

It has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the obesity epidemic is not a behavior society wants or can uphold. It puts a strain on everything and everyone. My airplane example is just a tiny blip in a universe of examples. Any shift to accomodate it, to accept it as the new normal, would punish people for being healthy and reward people for not being that. It would be an unbalanced system that _will_ blow up at some point. 

In this case, people would become unhealthier even faster, because they're now rewarded for it. Until we get into this strange WALL-E situation where no human is fit enough to do any work and our medical system can't handle it all.

It's like ... do these obesity support organizations not understand? When they complain about not fitting into a rollercoaster ride, because the seat was too narrow, do they understand the entire darn coaster was built by people who are strong and fit? That making the cars wider would have made the coaster take up twice as much space and cost twice as much money, meaning they'd probably also pay twice as much for their park ticket?

This is why everyone should practice system thinking. Why everyone should be a game developer! You can't just say "make seats wider, it's not hard". Such a thing has _consequences_. You shouldn't take actions based on what some people want, or how "easy" it is, but whether there are strong arguments for doing so. Whether it improves a system---or would actually destroy its balance. Especially because most people cannot see the system, cannot see the multiple factors, but only the single thing that _they_ care about.

Though most people don't want to hear it, the _shame_ you feel for being overweight is a _good thing_. It's a sign that you realize you're doing something wrong and might need to change. It's the natural trigger to become healthier.

A society that punishes extremely unhealthy people is a _good thing_. Not by taking away human rights, or by actively harming them, of course not! Simply by _not_ putting extra time and effort into accomodating them. Simply by _not_ actively rewarding them, while you _can_ think about actively rewarding people who stay healthy.

{{% remark %}}
My final note: I always find it odd how people are quick to call out "fat shaming" and defend how "everyone has the right to have any body, they should all receive equal support". You never hear them mention those same arguments about anything else. They are absolutely fine with having more _money_ than other people, for example. They are fine with criticizing organisations for _not_ pandering to them. But then, somehow, they fail to understand how they can also critize _them_? How people are _not_ the same and do _not_ have the same opportunities in our society, by design?

## But didn't you say you understand?

Yes, this is why I mentioned my own struggles to stay healthy. It _is_ hard. I can understand overweight people who say "I tried everything, but I think it's just my genes". I _know_ exactly how and why we got into this situation.

Many days, I feel like I'm one bad month away from being overweight myself. I exercise and work _a lot_, burning many calories, which requires me to eat quite a lot too. I'm afraid that one day I take a vacation, or I just can't make myself exercise anymore, and boom---I'm overweight too. I run every day of the week, except Sundays, and almost _every day_ I wake up and think "uuugh can't I just skip it today".

It's a struggle, it always will be, until the day you die. Society and capitalism make this even harder. You can all laugh at me if you read this article and, in ten years, you see me on television being several overweight or something.

But I try. And I am fine with things becoming inaccessible to me once I become unhealthy. In the same way that I am fine with being punished if I break a reasonable law. I understand that the _system_ needs to reward and punish certain behaviors to work. Despite how much my self-interest, my brain that goes "food! food! food!", makes up excuses to disagree with it.

As stated, I basically ate _whatever_ (including lots of sugar, snacks, etcetera) for 10 years as I grew up. This wasn't great. I will probably have to deal with that bad habit my entire life, because your eating habits are mostly formed as you grow up. Over the years, I saw myself grow slightly more overweight, and I kept telling myself "it's not that bad, I still exercise a lot" Until you're at a point where you just have to accept it _is_ getting bad and you have to change.

{{% remark %}}
I am lucky, in this sense, that I have a thin frame and a fast metabolism. I am slightly less likely to get fat, and even at my worst, others would still look at me and jokingly say I could "fit through the mailbox". I am also the proof why BMI or visuals are _not_ a great indicator for health. My BMI always hovered close to "underweight", even while I clearly had a belly. Just because I have a slight frame, it's dangerous to think I could eat whatever I want because it "won't really show, as long as I wear a shirt".

And then I haven't even talked about my hyperactivity! Because of my hyperactive brain and body, I _always_ want to do stuff, move around, create stuff. At the same time, I barely derive satisfaction from anything, so food is like a cheat shortcut to feeling at least a little good. This oftentimes combines into a perfect storm of "I need to eat more, and more, and more or I'll lack the energy to write another 3 chapters of that book tonight". Very dangerous---very hard to get rid of.
{{% /remark %}}

But simple habits, such as exercising each day, intermittent fasting, realizing it's good to feel full and to seek out such foods, helped a _lot_. I have a stand-up desk now, which means I rarely sit, and I'm far more likely to move around in general. I purposely placed my workspace far away from other things, to force me to take two flights of stairs numerous times a day. 

I have all sorts of tiny, simple habits that _challenge_ my body (and my eating habits) every single day. A silly one, for example, is that I sometimes eat until I have completely consumed the newspaper. Well ... then I have nothing left to read or do, so I stop eating, or I'll get bored! (And yes, I have a simple rule of leaving my phone at my work desk too, so it's never with me while I eat.)

Some people seem to believe that life should be fun all the time. That some people are just "motivated" to stay healthy, like a talent, and some are not. This is obviously not true. Instead, people actually derive _fun_ from _effort_. The bigger the challenge, the more satisfied we feel once we complete it. Once you experience this a few times---for example, by exercising and really challenging your body---the floodgates open. 

I believe people need that to _realize_ the effort is worth it. To realize it has nothing to do with motivation or character, but everything with just putting in the hard work. But so many people these days _stop_ as soon as things get _slightly hard_, so they never get to the fun part, they never get to experience the satisfaction afterwards.

Most of all, I think the most important step is to accept that you will _always_ have to worry about your health. It never ends. There are no days, months, or years off. Visiting the gym once in a blue moon does not mean you are "done" for that month and can sit on a chair and eat what you want. Life is an endless struggle to "do your best". Once you can accept that, I believe, it will be easier to put in that extra work each day and challenge yourself.

When people are asked about being overweight, they often claim it is "never a choice".

When people who are _not_ overweight are asked, they often claim it is "always a choice".

This article basically showed both sides and how, as usual, the truth is somewhere down the middle. Parts of it are a choice, parts are not. You can absolutely exercise more, but it's not a full solution. You can absolutely just eat less, but it's not "easy" in any way. You absolutely have the right to be fat if you want, and nobody should attack or belittle you for it, but you should also accept that this is unhealthy and society should not bend to your weighty will.

Hopefully, this (long) article achieved a few things.

* It explains the (current) statistics on obesity and why you should believe them, even if your personal perception tells you not to.
* It explains some of the best ways I know to actually improve your health and weight.
* It explains how we should _not_ start accepting obesity as normal and accomodating it, all in the name of that mythical "respect".

I'm not even sure why I write things like these. Just to get my thoughts out, I guess, and maybe help a few people or prevent systemic disasters. Perhaps a reminder to _myself_ to stay wary of my own eating habits.

So, as usual, these were my thoughts,
