Welcome to my update article for Summer 2025. It is an overview of the work I've done, projects I finished, and any other interesting developments during the months of July, August and September 2025. Let's see how it went!

## Where We Left Off

In the previous update, I explained that ...

* I was working _really hard_ on my online store that will launch start of next year.
* Our "home renovation" had become even more disastrous, limiting my options further.
* Because of this, I was falling behind a bit on the work I'd actually planned for this year.
* I might finally become a traditionally published author.

Well, the summary for this update is quite simple.

* Still working really hard on that online store 99% of the time.
* The renovation somehow became even _more_ disastrous.
* I caught up with some of that overdue work.
* @TODO: see what happens with that book and details on when it launches blabla

## The Online Store

Working hard, making stuff, still the work seems to never end :p

Whenever I complete another topic (like teaching basic shapes, or a child's first numbers (1--5), etcetera), more ideas have popped up. And I want to make them now, while still in that mood/flow, or risk never making them later. After working on a topic for a week, my brain finally figures out solutions to all the problems. And then suddenly, as I want to jump to the _next_ part of the curriculum, my brain is like "So THIS is how you turn that topic into a really good board game that anyone can play!"

Even with my productivity and discipline, I still have to _pick and choose_ what I want to do. Most topics I have "finished" actually had 10 more ideas for games, puzzles, quizzes, escape rooms, etcetera. But I had to say "maybe later" and move on, or get stuck in one topic forever.

Besides that, I usually "go along with the seasons". So, as it is summer now, I wanted to take a few weeks to make "summer-related products", instead of following my educational approach. This means activity books to take with you on holiday, board games to play on a camping, some fun fairy tales around summer/holiday, etcetera. 

I'm very sensitive to the weather, the world around me, the season, and so forth. I can't help it. I really really can't make such products---and make them well, without feeling weird---when it is _not_ summer. 

@TODO: more specifics once the season is actually over and I know what I've done

## The Overdue Work

For several years, I've released 5 _Wildebyte Arcades_ books and 10 _Saga of Life_ short stories (each year). I also did a massive update to all my websites (and any errors found in the meantime) each year. 

When those are my main projects, that's very doable. 

But now that the online store takes up all my time, I was falling behind. I kept telling myself "okay, next month I will have finished this next big pile of work for the webshop, and I will take a few weeks to write the next books/stories". I mean, I already have a plan for them, I know it can be done in a few weeks, and it would put me back on track.

But it just never happened. Because the online store became bigger and more ambitious each time. And every time it happened, I actually started _believing_ in the plan more. What started as "shit I need to earn money somehow" has become "I'm making really, really good products for this online store". I keep finding new clever ideas to put games and fun into education. I keep finding better approaches, completely new ideas that nobody has done before, and I _can_ and _will_ make all of that.

But that obviously takes time and energy. I only have so much of that in a day :p

And now the year is almost over. And I've fallen hopelessly behind on my old schedule for these two projects. It's not a lack of want or effort, it's just a lack of time.

The Wildebyte Arcades earns me barely enough to buy food for a day. Saga of Life earns me no money at all. Writing + editing + releasing for both took at least a few months of full-time work the past few years. And that was _without_ the distraction of "the online store" and "better ideas".

And so, I decided to keep it realistic. To scale it back.

I always planned to keep doing 1 "cycle" for Saga of Life per year until the 5th cycle. (I already predicted the project would be big enough then to slow down to "just" half a cycle, or 5 stories, a year.)

The Wildebyte Arcades have no reason to stick to their schedule at all. I simply picked something that worked and ran with it, but _most_ book series obviously only release 1 book a year.

And so I decided to _finish this Saga of Life cycle completely_. I kept the stories shorter, more focused, easier to finish and edit. But I wanted the full cycle done this year because of the reason stated above.

This left very little time for Wildebyte Arcades. Luckily, I had written ahead quite a bit. But starting next year, the speed of book releases in that series will simply take a huge hit. I will likely "only" release 2 Wildebyte Arcades books next year.

## Anything Else?

I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to say about the renovation. There are huge legal battles happening now, it's mostly out of our hands. But the short version is that our home is basically unliveable, and has been for a while. No heating (or air conditioning) at all for years. Wouldn't make much sense too, because we literally have huge holes in our house where windows should've been placed. No space. No certainty of electricity, wi-fi, water, etcetera. Only a single place for _all_ utilities, in a home of 8 people, which is a small box standing in our backyard.

And all of that because the builder who took up the project lied to us, never showed up, never did (proper) work, and then, after extracting as much as he could from my parents, literally disappeared and filed for bankruptcy.

So, yeah, not great. Another reason why I'm all in on the online shop. It's a thing I can still make, even in these circumstances, and I really need to start earning solid money to either get out of the house or help my parents pay to fix our house.

And so I will quickly make the usual statements!

* Recording music is not possible now.
* More technologically intense projects (such as creating video games again, editing videos, etcetera) are not possible now.
* Basically anything else I might want to do is not possible now.

Really, after all those years, I'm used to it. Like everyone else here. We shrug, we buckle down, we continue working hard.

The final update of this year likely won't say anything different. I will have finally finished all my "level 1" products for the online store. I will hopefully take a bit of a break around the holidays. And if lucky, my book will be published and maybe generate some sales/popularity.

And then, next year, you can all finally gaze in wonder at the beauty of an online store I launched ;)

Until the next update,
