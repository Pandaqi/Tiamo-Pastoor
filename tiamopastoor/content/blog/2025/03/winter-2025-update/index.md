Welcome to my update article for Winter 2025. It is an overview of the work I've done, projects I finished, and any other interesting developments during the months of January, February and March 2025. Let's see how it went!

## Webshop(s)

At the start of January, to the surprise of many including myself, I launched a [small Dutch webshop](https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl). I repurposed my oldest domain to set up a kind of "test store" for me to learn how all this works. To play around, make some merchandise, and make all big mistakes _before_ they can actually cost me. (That oldest domain contained my Dutch blog, before it moved to this new website, and was originally set to expire in a few months.)

I'll admit this was a bit of an improvisation. When I decide something, I really _go for it_, and I had that Dutch webshop up and running (completely verified, 50+ unique products/designs, tested, etcetera) within a week or two.

But it wasn't completely random. I'd been considering creating an online store for _years_. And this year, with me growing older still and my income growing smaller still, I decided I just had to pull the trigger. I made a plan for a much larger online store, which would sell lots of my existing work (digital goods) + new designs (physical goods).

That (mostly Dutch) webshop was just a nice first step to take. It taught me _a lot_, changed my designs for the bigger webshop for the better (a thousand times over), and so I continued.

Because that webshop hasn't launched yet, I can't give much details about it now. (Not because of secrecy or whatever, but because it won't make sense until I can show it.) Below is a very succinct summary of the work.

First, I designed the skeleton of that web shop myself, then once in a while spent a week improving it and adding lots of necessary features. (At time of writing, the entire custom-built online store is fully functional. It's not "done", as it still has many "nice features" I'd like to add, but those are all optional.)

Then, alternating with work on the website, I created the _actual content_.

A good chunk of it meant uploading _existing work_. That is, projects I'd already done, designs I'd already made. One major category of that store will contain the source files for a lot of my work, or extra products based on existing brands of mine (such as _Wildebyte Arcades_).

But the majority of the work meant _creating new things_. I created a bunch of ...

* Escape room experiences. (Some thematic, such as one to try with the family during Easter, and some that could be played any time.)
* Educational material. (Through Pandaqi Tutorials, and thinking about education since I was a little boy, I've always had the idea I could design some fun extra activities or worksheets to complement school. It took my money-hating brain a _while_ before realizing that I could, you know, sell that work.)
* Quizzes. (In many shapes and sizes. Pub quizzes, analog or digital, more educational trivia things, etcetera. Me and my sister have been designing quizzes for New Year's Eve for _years_, I even wrote my own software for it. Again, it took me a _while_ to realize I could sell that work.)
* Merchandise. (My little test shop taught me a lot about that. With the lessons learned, I could use my existing brands or "franchises" to turn them into physical goods too)
* And more miscellaneous or experimental things.

In due time, I might remove some things I've been offering for free all this time, and put them (as paid products) on the store instead. For now, however, I wasn't ready to take that step. I strongly feel, for example, that my tutorials and print-n-play board games should forever stay free and accessible. 

I've mostly created _new_ things (even if based on existing designs/work of mine) for the store launch.

Similarly, there are some "next level" ideas for which I need to figure out the monetization now. A next step in terms of skill, quality, size inside the general creative areas in which I work. But that's getting into 2026/2027 territory, and I can't predict the future, so let's forget that for now.

Most of all, here's the deal. I don't have money. As such, I've always worked hard to stay lean, and minimal, and be smart about how to create and host my projects. This means that the online store is _cheap_ for me to run ... but not _free_, of course.

There is no such thing as hosting 6 large websites, reliably, quickly, available worldwide, for free :p Getting connected to payment providers and running a safe/secure shopping system adds significant extra fees on top for that online store.

I have about 1--2 years of runway before I'd probably have to call it quits. With current numbers, and some margin for error, that web shop would have to earn ~40 dollars a month in _profit_ to pay for itself. 

That's why I wanted to launch the webshop soon (this year), but not _too_ soon, and launch it with a good catalog of products.

This is where I spent the majority of my time this season. Creating everything needed for that online store, and creating the things sold on it. As you'll see below, I mostly _worked (far) ahead_ on other projects to make sure I still met all my deadlines.

## Writing

### Saga of Life

I was falling a bit behind on my **Saga of Life** stories (cycle #4), so I caught up to about halfway that cycle. For those who don't know, the Saga is a free website filled with interconnected short stories. I write one "cycle" a year, which means 10 short stories that move through the 10 time periods of that world. 

Because this is an ongoing project that is subdivided that way, it never really "sleeps". I can work ahead for a bit, but I end up writing a few stories for this every season. 

That's on purpose. I designed the whole thing to not overwhelm my hyperactive brain, but _also_ to make sure I never completely lose momentum. So far, it's been achieving exactly what I designed it to do.

Although, for this cycle, I did a larger single batch with the five first stories. (Instead of writing story 1, moving away, coming back for story 2, etcetera.) 

Why? I looked at my plans for the rest of the year and thought "ugh, it's going to be REALLY annoying to switch back and forth between Saga and those other projects". Experience told me that these specific kinds of projects do not "mesh" well, which means switching between them every week would probably cause me a lot of motivation/momentum/focus issues.

So I thought, halfway January: let's just get as many Saga stories out of the way _now_.

Doing so also brought a few more "breakthroughs" about the Saga. I realized some (major) changes I wanted to make going into the future. For example, which ideas to pick and which to push to different projects. You write and you learn!

I've given myself basically until the end of cycle 5 to be flexible and allow the Saga to grow in different ways. Thus, at the end of next year, afer 50 stories, I hope to have figured out the "definitive" tone, style, story length, topics covered, etcetera.

### Wildebyte Arcades

Besides that, the **Wildebyte Arcades** received a few new books. I write 10 of them a year, but release only 5. So I'm ahead of schedule but still want to keep good pace. If I manage to keep that up, then the entire **Handheld Disk** (all books where our main character lands inside a mobile/handheld game) will be done! (And then it will take 2 or 3 years before _all_ those books are actually in the hands of fans.)

I _did_ want to take a little break, though. After the first 10 books, I noticed the stories become a bit "same-y", while I disliked some of the mistakes I kept making again and again. So I waited before writing book 11 (and on) for as long as I could.

Those two projects are my main "ongoing writing work". To keep things fresh, and because I simply want to get my ideas made as quickly as possible, I regularly switch to smaller writing projects. Things nobody is expecting and that could release whenever.

In this case, I still had 2 (shorter) books to finish from last season. (You know, when I spontanously wrote the _first half_ of two different books around Christmas.)

That left little time for anything else. The only thing that _is_ progressing steadily is ... a secret project. I'll probably share more about it in a later update, once I am _certain_ when and how it's going to be finished and released.

## Games

Same old, same old.

There are a few large video games that I've always wanted to make, but now is simply not the right time. Terrible working circumstances and hardware, very risky, by far the MOST work for the LEAST certainty of income/career, etcetera.

Then there are tiny video games for which I already created the structure. But these are clearly lowest on my priority list, so other stuff keeps being made while these are pushed back.

In the end, I made a few more board games (for release in 2026; this year's game release schedule is already full). And then I mostly made "game-like" experiences for that webshop, such as escape rooms or educational activities.

## Music & More

I've often said that I am actually a musician. And I really mean that. There are nearly 500 song ideas on my hard drive, many of which I feel are _really good_ and _should be made_.

But as the renovation keeps being a disaster here at home (because of the main builders/architect, not my parents or us), there is just _no way_. I can't even stand somewhere and hold a guitar, that's how little _space_ there is. Let alone get a relatively soundproof (and echo-free) room to record something.

{{% update %}}
I wrote this part rather early in the winter. As I read it back now, before publishing, I must unfortunately say the renovation has become much, much worse still. Let's just say that "renovation" is a big word for a home without heating, doors, windows, or even a toilet, where once in a blue moon a builder might show up to do something in completely the wrong way.

The urge to record music again remains strong as ever, but I keep searching for ways to make it happen anyway and finding none.

I even have music attached to BOOKS now---sometimes an entire musical for my most important novels---and I really want to let readers listen to that too! Music just adds _so much_ to anything, both while creating the story and while enjoying it. Within my _Saga of Life_ folder, for example, are about 10 tracks attached to main characters or main events (many yet to happen in the stories). But they're cursed recordings made with my phone, of me playing the guitar and humming the melody as well as I can without waking anyone else :p
