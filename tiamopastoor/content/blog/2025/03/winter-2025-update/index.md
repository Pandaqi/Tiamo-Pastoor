Welcome to my update article for Winter 2025. It is an overview of the work I've done, projects I finished, and any other interesting developments during the months of January, February and March 2025. Let's see how it went!

## Writing

I was falling a bit behind on my **Saga of Life** stories (cycle #4), so I caught up to about halfway that cycle. For those who don't know, the Saga is a free website filled with interconnected short stories. I write one "cycle" a year, which means 10 short stories that move through the 10 time periods of that world. 

Because this is an ongoing project that is subdivided that way, it never really "sleeps". I can work ahead for a bit, but I end up writing a few stories for this every season. 

That's on purpose. I designed the whole thing to not overwhelm my hyperactive brain, but _also_ to make sure I never completely lose momentum. So far, it's been achieving exactly what I designed it to do.

Besides that, the **Wildebyte Arcades** received a few new books. I write 10 of them a year, but release only 5. So I'm ahead of schedule but still want to keep good pace. If I manage to keep that up, then the entire **Handheld Disk** (all books where our main character lands inside a mobile/handheld game) will be done! (And then it will take 2 or 3 years before _all_ those books are actually in the hands of fans.)

I _did_ want to take a little break, though. After the first 10 books, I noticed the stories become a bit "same-y", while I disliked some of the mistakes I kept making again and again. So I waited before writing book 11 (and on) for as long as I could.

Those two projects are my main "ongoing writing work". To keep things fresh, and because I simply want to get my ideas made as quickly as possible, I regularly switch to smaller writing projects. Things nobody is expecting and that could release whenever.

In this case, I still had 2 (shorter) books to finish from last season. (You know, when I spontanously wrote the _first half_ of two different books around Christmas.)

That left little time for anything else. The only thing that _is_ progressing steadily is ... a secret project. I'll probably share more about it in a later update, once I am _certain_ when and how it's going to be finished and released.

## Games

Same old, same old.

There are a few large video games that I've always wanted to make, but now is simply not the right time. Terrible working circumstances and hardware, very risky, by far the MOST work for the LEAST certainty of income/career, etcetera.

Then there are tiny video games for which I already created the structure. But these are clearly lowest on my priority list, so other stuff keeps being made while these are pushed back.

In the end, I made a few more board games (for release in 2026; this year's game release schedule is already full), and I made a few more (printable, free) escape rooms (not sure when or in what form they'll be published).

## Music & More

I've often said that I am actually a musician. And I really mean that. There are nearly 500 song ideas on my hard drive, many of which I feel are _really good_ and _should be made_.

But as the renovation keeps being a disaster here at home (because of the main builders/architect, not my parents or us), there is just _no way_. I can't even stand somewhere and hold a guitar, that's how little _space_ there is. Let alone get a relatively soundproof (and echo-free) room to record something.

The urge to record music again remains strong as ever, but I keep searching for ways to make it happen anyway and finding none.

I even have music attached to BOOKS now---sometimes an entire musical for my most important novels---and I really want to let readers listen to that too! Music just adds _so much_ to anything, both while creating the story and while enjoying it. Within my Saga of Life folder, for example, are about 10 tracks attached to main characters or main events (many yet to happen in the stories). But they're cursed recordings made with my phone, of me playing the guitar and humming the melody as well as I can without waking anyone else :p
