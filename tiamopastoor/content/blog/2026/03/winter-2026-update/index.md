Welcome to my update article for Winter 2026. It is an overview of the work I've done, projects I finished, and any other interesting developments during the months of January, February, and March 2026. Let's see how it went!

## Where We Left Off

In the previous update, I explained that ...

* I was busy with an online store set to launch in January 2026.
* I set some simple resolutions for the next year, mostly about making sure I don't fall into bad/worse habits and making sure I take time to do not-online-store-things :p

## The Online Store

Well, the good news is that I kept my promise/deadline on the first part and [launched that online store](https://thewaywardmelody.com)! 

It's live now. It's official. It's approved in all the places it had to be approved. You can actually buy things and I will earn money from that.

Is it "done"? "Perfect"? A "big success"? No, of course not. I explained in previous updates how I'd hoped to get more done, but had to settle for picking my battles. I launched with a "good chunk" of Level 1 done. This year I want to finish Level 1 and get started with Level 2 products. I launched with a website that looks quite nice and has the necessary features, but I certainly have a file with some wishes and some doubts behind the scenes.

I did the basic "marketing" for this store by permanently linking it and mentioning it whenever relevant on all my other websites. But that's obviously the bare minimum. For example, Google also recognizes that as just linking between a handful of your own websites and doesn't put much stock into that.

Before launch, I made a list of ideas for promoting it and making sure people can find it. For example, give away products in the relevant subreddits, mention the store and its vision in places where teachers are, put more work into hitting all the right keywords on my best products. 

I ... can't say I struck many items off that list. There's so much to do and to focus on when launching this thing that I just didn't find the time yet. I _know_ it's important. Without this marketing, despite how much quality my store offers, very few have been able to find it. The fact I have a list of specific "promotion activities" at all is great progress compared to years ago, I'll just need to make it a habit this year of following through.

Instead of marketing the store, I've been making _more things for it_! The first three months of the year don't have many holidays or special themes going on, which is good, because it allowed me to focus on the curriculum/educational stuff again. I'd basically ignored that for two months at the end of 2025 as I made stuff for Christmas, Halloween, etcetera. Slowly but surely, I chipped away at the worksheets and teacher materials left for the final Level 1 topics.

It's a bit boring, though, I must admit. I only create these "traditional" educational materials in hopes of attracting people to the store and earning a baseline income. The actual value of my work comes from educational games, puzzles, stories, etcetera. Basically all the more "advanced" things I make _after_ getting the lesson materials over with.

But I try to find a balance. I try to power through some boring days and then "reward" myself by finally being able to make an actually fun and effective way to explore a topic or skill.

Those quotation marks around "reward" are doing some heavy lifting, because the reward basically means 20 hours of really hard work trying to get a difficult idea off the ground. But that's still easier for me, and more valuable, than 4 hours of extremely boring work.

This way, most of the Level 1 stuff is _done_, and I managed to slip in a good number of those advanced products. For example, the quantity of "educational games" is much healthier now than it was at launch :p It sure felt a bit silly that I started an online store to show how everything could be taught through games ... and only had like 6 games.

There's not much else to say. Lots of work done, lots of work still to do. I wanted to link to some noteworthy products here (to show what I'm talking about), but I didn't know what to choose. 

So I'll just say that, at time of writing, I just finished [T-Rex Tells](https://thewaywardmelody.com/gamiverses/level-1/maths/t-rex-tells/). I'm also nearly done with [Fruity Finish](https://thewaywardmelody.com/gamiverses/level-1/maths/fruity-finish/) and I _finally_ completed the story bundle called [The Matching Myths](https://thewaywardmelody.com/explorers/level-1/maths/the-matching-myths/). That one was hard. It required a lot of images, which I wanted to draw myself, but my hardware makes it impossible, so I eventually had to use AI images and tell myself "I'll do it properly in the future". It was one of those moments where I really have to tell myself "just make it exist, don't make it perfect, just get it done and move on for now".

Anyway, I'll probably give more (financial/visior) statistics on the store in the next update, when I actually have more data to report.

## The Not-Online-Store

Look, it's getting harder and harder. The online store was specifically set up to allow displaying and selling _all the things I do_. To make it easy and simple for me to do so. Every little thing that interests me, every kind of skill I ever tried to do, has a nice little predefined place on that store.

So ... _everything_ I do now starts to appear on the store! 

Even tiny ideas I'd have put on Pandaqi for free before, or maybe written into a free Saga of Life story, are now subtly (almost subconsciously) repurposed to be sold on the store.

On the one hand, I'm tempted to say "No, stop that!" To tell myself: "Keep doing tiny projects that are NOT sold on the store, keep separate side projects!"

On the other hand, I've seen this past year how much the quality and speed of my work _improves_ by putting it on the store. By knowing I have a place for it, a deadline, a price tag, I've found it easier to work on it for longer and make things to a higher standard. Probably because my brain thinks it has to be good enough to be sold for money. It has to be good enough that nobody gets mad at me for paying that money and being disappointed. And, thus, the things I made for the store are all higher quality and more refined.

For example, I recently hosted a special kind of party at home with the family. We played "Wie is de Mol?" at home, which is a very popular TV program in the Netherlands. It was just for fun, it was obviously free, and I just worked for a few days to create that special experience (for New Year's Eve). Nothing special. Nothing for-profit. Just putting effort into a family activity.

But when it was over, I discovered "Wait a minute, people are _selling_ this kind of work?" There are tons of online stores selling "murder mystery packs", or packs inspired by popular tv programs, recreating that with family/friends at home. The work I just did for that family activity is something other people are actually selling online. Successfully. For quite a bit of money. And I hope I don't sound like a jerk now, but the quality of their work is quite a bit lower than what I just made. (Those people are just doing this on the side, while I've been a professional game designer and visual designer for years. There's a difference :p)

And so you start wondering. _Should_ I sell this? Should I turn something free and family-oriented into another thing "for profit"? If I did, I know I could earn enough money to sustain the store _and_ I would make much BETTER stuff because it has to earn its price tag. But then it stops being this special, free, do-it-for-love thing, right? If I do that, then ... even special family moments become just another playtest for things I want to sell.

Yes, I'm still figuring this out. For now, _most_ ideas and projects of mine can easily be put on the online store. That's just the best place for them now, that's just smart and doesn't hurt anyone. It's hard _not_ to make everything about money when you have none and you're currently freezing your ass off in a home without heating. 

But I'm trying to hold off on some things, trying to keep a few "not-online-store" or "not-for-sale" hobbies in my life. I'll let you know how that went in the future :p

## Anything Else?

Ugh, I feel like a broken record. I keep saying I want to record all those great song ideas of mine, every darn update, yet I never find the space, time, or health for it. And the folder with song ideas only grows! I'm not exaggerating when I say there's probably 500 ideas for songs in there, of which I'd say 200 are pretty good, and 100 are really good and complete enough to record right now. 

But ... well, until I record them, nobody else hears them. And I don't know if I'm mad and it's actually all terrible, or if I'm right! 

Almost every day, I play the piano (or guitar), and I have so many songs now that I'm just 100% playing my own stuff. And people keep asking me what song I just played, saying it's gorgeous. And then they're very disappointed when it's not a real song they can listen to right now---because it's just a song of mine, in my head :p

What I'm saying is that I have a _lot_ of musical ideas and a _lot_ of social proof that they're very good. I just need to find a way to consistently record and publish them. I think having the store running and earning a stable income would help a lot here. It would allow me to work on music without worrying about money for a bit, and allow buying some crucial equipment.

I have a decent microphone and all now. But I lack the most important thing: acoustic treatment. There are no rooms in our house where I don't get an awful sound from the microphone because of the room echo / sound waves interactions. 

I created a little "recording cave" with blankets/matresses myself years ago and it made a MASSIVE difference in sound quality. It saved 10+ hours of work on each album, while making each take actually usable. But I can't do that anymore because that old room of mine is gone, even those blankets and matresses are gone, and I'm not allowed to do it anywhere else.

Anyway, it's not helpful when every recording sounds unusable and unprofessional because of a terrible acoustic space. This is not in my head, I'm pretty sure, there is a massive audible difference here. You can't just place your microphone anywhere in a small, boxy, untreated bedroom and expect it to sound fine.
