This is a _huge_ update! I've written 7 full-length, high-quality courses containing everything I know about writing and publishing stories. (Including images, examples, challenges, etcetera. Though more of that will come in the future.)

The courses I'm talking about are **Storytelling, Plot, Character, Worldbuilding, Prose, Dialogue** and **Publishing**.

I recommend you start with [Storytelling][1]. It's a course for beginners that takes you through the process of writing a story from start to finish, and links to the other (more specific) courses whenever needed.

Besides that, I've also added tutorials on **HTML** and **CSS** (coding languages required for creating websites). I wanted to add more website languages, but this update was already huge and I ran out of time. Those will arrive next year, with the next "batch" of tutorials.

Is that all? No! I had a long list of fixes and improvements to **_all_** **my websites**, though especially Pandaqi Tutorials, and finally managed to execute all of it. In short: all my websites have been updated and improved.

Such a short post like this really doesn't do justice to the massive amount of free educational content I have added. I hope many people give it a try and learn from it!

The plan is to do one such (massive) update each year. Over time, new ideas pop up and new issues with my current websites/content reveal themselves. Additionally, writing a batch of related tutorials makes more sense than writing them one by one (with lots of time between them).

Enjoy!
