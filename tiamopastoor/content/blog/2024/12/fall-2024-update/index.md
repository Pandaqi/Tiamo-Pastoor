Welcome to my update article for Fall 2024. It is an overview of the work I've done, projects I finished, and any other interesting developments during the months of October, November and December 2024. Let's see how it went!

## Writing

After having made the decision that writing will be my "main job", at least in the coming future, it's a bit easier to prioritize things and plan further ahead.

* I would like to write **10 Wildebyte books per year**. To reach that, I "only" needed to finish part of book this year. (It's somewhat of an arbitrary number. But I release 5 of them each year, so writing 10 just felt like a nice way to create a buffer and work ahead each year.)
* Completely finish **Saga of Life (Cycle #3)**. Just a few final translations to go.
* Do a second edit on a **standalone novel** I somewhat accidentally wrote, to be released near the holidays.

Now, normally, this would be it. I've written more than enough this year; I will just take a break and start the next cycle of stories/books next year.

But it feels really weird to call something your full-time job and then just not do it for nearly 3 months. It also feels like a waste of time, because I am overflowing with strong story ideas that need to be made at some point.

As such, I decided to finally pull the trigger on what has been my "next writing project in line" for quite some time now. 

It's still a collection of shorter novels. That's just what my hyperactive brain prefers; that's where my ideas naturally land. In fact, they'll probably be half the length of the Wildebyte books.

There is no rush here and no planned release date for any of that. But at least I was able to keep writing and keep turning some more ideas into actual stories to give to the world. I am even tempted to just completely finish that collection before releasing the first one, but I'll only do that if it doesn't take too long to finish. (I don't like just "sitting" on 10 or 20 finished stories for years on end.)

Interestingly, I have absolutely no issue reading huge novels. In fact, that's most of what I've read: huge fantasy novels, sprawling epics, 500 page books that move at a glacial pace. There's this clear disconnect between my PRODUCING brain and my CONSUMING brain, where the first one is bored extremely easily and creates only small projects/pieces, but the second one can actually focus and keep attention on huge stuff far more easily than those around me.

## Games

### Board Games

There were a few board games that were 90% finished but I simply forgot to finish them. That happens when I am tired of a project and "don't feel like finishing it", so I do something else for a few days, and before you know it I forgot the old project existed at all!

I simply had to finish them now, because their deadlines for release were coming up. When I say "finishing", I mean stuff like ...

* Creating a pretty cover image for it.
* Fixing three typos in the rulebook + updating the PDF to download to that fixed version
* Writing the actual marketing blurb ( = "short description") for the game.

So the game itself is done and I know it works and will be released. It's just all the _other stuff_ that comes with 100% finishing a project and giving it to others that I still sometimes forget.

While doing so, I realized that if I created 3 more board games ... I'd have finished all board game projects for next year! If disaster strikes, and I suddenly forget how board games work overnight or something, I have a year to recover because I'm that far ahead of schedule :p

No, it just felt like a nice timing to finish all 2025 board games when 2024 finishes. Also, those 3 final ideas were rather simple and short, and I just knew they would be great fun to try with the family during the holidays. So I needed them done before then.

This excludes one big board game project, though. But I don't consider that part of my regular board games. That's it's own, large project that deserves its own time.

I will probably talk about it a lot in the update when it releases. I already briefly talked about it before, I think, but I can't find it now so I must not have mentioned it by its working title.

Besides that I have nothing special to mention. My Pandaqi website is extremely solid now and makes creating + showing new board games very easy. I also didn't do any crazy experimental stuff, like inventing new genres of board games, so yeah.

I also didn't make a lot of topical games this year, such as a game made specifically for Christmas or Easter. Which removes another potential topic of interest to mention here :p

As usual, for all the updates on my games and that website, go to [Pandaqi Blog](https://pandaqi.com/blog/).

### Video Games

This is the big one for this update.

I realized that I am just not built for the regular career of a video game developer. The games I make are too different from what people will buy in droves. I am too easily distracted and bored to work on a project for very long, and even the simplest "sellable" video games _take a long time_. It's absolutely the most complicated and involved creative product you can try to make. And I am not really interested (or playing) in making the things that _would_ probably earn a solid income.

I realized that I am making amazing board games now, but the number of people playing board games is faaaar smaller than the number of people playing games. And of those people, only a subsection would download and print their own game (if interested enough). Even the worst video game I ever made has probably been played by more people than my best board game.

What to do?

As I said, writing is my main work. It's full-time, at least 4 days a week.

That leaves 2 or 3 days for "something else". (I _really try_ to take one day off completely, usually Sunday.) And I think that should increasingly be tiny video games that only I will ever make.

Last update I talked about just playing around creating tiny web games. This season I basically evolved that idea into something even better suited for _me_. Something I can make 100% in a day or two, which is always local multiplayer, and extremely easy to pick up and play for any group of people.

I do still have a handful of "big games" I either need to 100% finish (they're 80%--90% done now) or that I really want to make because I think they'll be great. I wrote down a _specific_ plan of action for them, with clear priorities and limited scope (to make sure they ARE finished when I make them). 

But there's currently no actual deadline or certainty about making them. I still have terrible hardware (or "general working circumstances" really) that simply makes large game projects too much of a pain to work on. I also learned a lot from previous failures and am much better at _not_ overworking myself and being realistic about how big a game made on my own _can be_.

@TODO: Actually give specifics once the season is over and I can show/point at stuff.

## Anything Else?

Usually, this is the place where I talk about more personal stuff. Maybe some philosophical rambling, maybe some major changes to my situation, who knows.

But ... I don't have anything to add.

Any personal insights, developments, thoughts are usually a separate article published on this blog. So I suggest you read some of the latest personal articles for updates on that. The rate of those, however, also slowed down compared to last year. Maybe I'm becoming boring; let's pretend I am becoming more _stable_ :p

This is, I guess, the danger of becoming good at something. Even without a planning or structure, I hit deadlines far in advance, I finish all my projects now, and when I set out to do something ... I just do it? I know it can be done, I know how it must be done, I know how long it will take, and I am right. Most of the time.

Which makes it very enticing, especially to hyperactive brains like mine, to purposely do weird shit and surprise myself. Because it's boring when things go according to plan! If I'm not struggling with some highly experimental project, then why am I even making it!?

But I am older now and wiser. I know I can do one or two "highlight" projects per year. Those are the ideas I think have the most potential and might become masterpieces, so I'm allowed to experiment and challenge myself and do completely new things. Everything else? Keep it simple, keep it managable, keep it low maintenance.

> _There is value in knowing you can do something (easily/according to plan/not-a-masterpiece) and then still doing it._

Some of my best board games did not challenge me in any way or do anything new. I knew the exact parts I needed, I knew how long it'd take, I did that, and it just worked. That doesn't change that now a game exists that didn't exist before, and that the game is fun to play.

Some of my best (short) stories simply had a very clear outline that came to me as I was showering or riding my bike. I wrote down the outline---a bullet point list of exact scenes to hit---then simply expanded that. It was a pretty straightforward "uncreative" process, like checking things off of a grocery list for hours. That doesn't change that a story now exists that nobody else wrote before, and that the story is solid.

There you have it. Still a nice philosophical quote to end on.

Onto next year! Hopefully with more cool projects and, if the gods shine their favor upon me, and the planets align, and the pigs dance after dark, and favorable winds blow in my general direction, actual income from them.
