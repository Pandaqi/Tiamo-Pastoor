Welcome to my update article for Spring 2024. It is an overview of the work I've done, projects I finished, and any other interesting developments during the months of April, May and June 2024. Let's see how it went!

@TODO: This is mostly speculation now, revise the update before it goes live.

## Writing work

### Saga of Life

[The Saga of Life](https://thesagaoflife.com/en/) is currently at cycle 3, and I write one cycle (10 stories) per year. I want to leave enough time to write a story, then _leave it alone_, then revise it later, which means I need to write ahead of schedule.

That's why last season I wrote up to and including story 8. A few of them needed _heavy_ revisions, but at least the first draft was there.

This season I ...

* Wrote stories 9 and 10.
* Revised and translated until story 8. (Wanted to do until 10, but that just left way too little time between writing first draft and doing second draft.)
* Finally got around to translating stories from cycle 2. (Currently there's this weird gap where stories from cycle 1 and 3 are available in English, but not the cycle in-between :p)
* Made a few minor improvements to the website.

I don't want to get stuck writing the same types of stories over and over. I would like there to be a clear improvement or change in some area between cycles. (Like how, going from cycle 1 to cycle 2, I'd learned to be less reliant on loads of dialogue.) That's why I delayed already planning stories for cycle 4. Let some new thoughts and fresh inspiration come in, and allow myself to be a slightly better writer before the next cycle starts.

### Wildebyte Arcades

Last season, I wrote up to and including book 6 for [Wildebyte Arcades](https://tiamopastoor.com/series/wildebyte-arcades/). Everything after book 3, however, still needed revisions and a final version.

As these books are already planned to release throughout the year, I have clear deadlines for doing those revisions about once per month. I usually dread it, just because that final bit of editing and revising is so _boring_, but it's usually done within a day or two.

This season I aimed for book 10, but was fine with landing anywhere before that. These books aren't planned to release for a looong time.

@TODO

## Games work

I'm gearing up to finally buy a new, functional computer. I know what I need know (in terms of components/specifications) to optimize my current and future work, I've decided to build the thing myself (cheaper and teaches a skill I find useful), and my current laptop has slowly surpassed that threshold of "this is too broken even for Tiamo to work with".

For example, it can randomly restart. It takes about 15 minutes before it's booted. My graphics design software simply decides _not_ to boot half the time. Etcetera. 

{{% remark %}}
Hence why I write novels and create simple board games, as more than that is pretty impossible. I mean, my novels are literally written as plain text files, one per chapter, as opening Microsoft Word was already out of the question a few years ago.

Once I have a new computer, I can finally resume video game development. I have a few older, big games that are 90% done that I really want to officially release in 2025. I look to create/finish those games to go with the Wildebyte books too.

But until then ... it's still only board games!

Because I had so much writing (and translating) work to do, the progress here is quite light.

* I finished that 4th game prototype I mentioned in the previous update.
* I moved those 5 Easter games of mine to a polished/finished state as much as possible.
* I continued the Naivigation project by adding the next few vehicles.
* I started on the next batch of my "smallest, simplest games", but nothing definitive yet.

@TODO

## Big Fat Website Update

As stated, this is also the time when I do a "Big Fat Website Update". Although, honestly, I also do many minor updates throughout the year, so it ends up not being as spectacular as that.

In this case,

### All Websites

* I discovered I forgot to minify my CSS. At some point, I turned that off or just glossed over it, I don't know. Now I turned it on again, creating smaller webpages literally _everywhere_.
* I removed the final external dependency: Google Fonts. Over the years, I already started switching by simply downloading the fonts and hosting them myself on the website. Now I also switched the core fonts of all websites and any older projects that still required this.
  * _Why?_ I don't want to depend on Google Fonts staying exactly the same, and online, forever. This makes my pages faster and smaller, and the only reason they'd ever go down is if _I_ make a mistake.

### Pandaqi Studio

This is by far my biggest, most complex website. As such, it saw the most updates.

* I finally moved _all_ code to TypeScript. (A superset of the usual code language, JavaScript, which gives more safety and more tools for ensuring your code is correct and runs.)
* Similarly, I moved all _older games_ to my newer, cleaner, faster, generalized system for generating and displaying board games.
* I finally finished my [PQ Words](https://github.com/Pandaqi/pq-words) project: a set of word lists differentiated by type, complexity and category. I already use this myself in all my word (party) games.
* I finally created a fixed list of _categories_ and _tags_, then neatly used those for all projects. (Until now, I haphazardly chose whatever came to mind when I made the game page, which resulted in categorization that made no sense and didn't help find games at all.) 
* Just a huge, huge cleanup and reorganization behind the scenes. Made the website build much faster and reduced the number of folders/files/magic-urls-lets-hope-this-doesnt-break needed by a ton.

### Pandaqi Tutorials

I wrote a few new tutorials, some of which were already halfway done as I had an old draft that was present on the _old_ version of Pandaqi Tutorials.

I already fixed some bugs and added some (better) interactive tools. Those are the things that actually make the tutorials worthwhile, as playing and interactivity are actually how people _learn_, so I try my best on those.

@TODO

### The other websites

All of them required fixes and slight improvements, but they're all so minor that it's not interesting enough to mention here. It's just that I know such minor fixes pile up over years and years and will make my websites much better and modern in 5 years time than they are now. (Or would be otherwise, if I hadn't performed yearly maintenance.)

## Anything else?

I also mentioned my goal to do _something different_ than writing and board games (and light website coding). In fact, I mention this desire regularly in these updates.

But as I explained at the Games section, I'm severely limited in the digital work I can do.

I thought I might try and record music again. But my parents currently renovate the house, which means I have no space, no silence, and no sleep---so that's not going to work.

Another reason why I'm hesitant to buy a new, expensive computer. I don't trust that thing to survive the amount of rubble, mess, and rough builder treatment that's coming up the next 6 months.
{{% /remark %}}

I thought I might take up a different sport or non-digital hobby/skill/challenge. I couldn't find anything. I already physically exercise in a lot of different ways, and have done so my entire life. When I was really young, it wasn't rare to see me play soccer in the back garden, then get bored and grab a hockey stick and continue that way :p

Alas, the only "different" thing I did was start a secret writing project (which I already planned to start at some point anyway) and research how quickly I _could_ get space, silence, sleep, and a working computer.

## Conclusion

Another season, another boatload of work.

We were already far ahead of schedule in terms of board game releases. Now we're also ahead of schedule when it comes to writing, which is nice. (They're roughly in sync now, everything done until halfway 2025, so let's keep it that way.)

Honestly, the "translation" part is toughest for me. I _know_ all those Saga of Life stories from cycle 2 need to be translated at some point. Rather sooner than later. But translating 150,000 words from Dutch to English is still a gigantic task, and not one that really interests me. So I'm glad I got most of that out of the way this season.

{{% remark %}}
It does repeatedly remind me how much more compact English is and how many expressions it has that take three times as many words in Dutch. When translating, I feel very free to add small flourishes or extra sentences, because I know the word count will still end up _lower_ than its Dutch counterpart. 
{{% /remark %}}

So, next season,

* Hopefully wraps up _all_ translations left to do.
* I have some more freedom to do a bigger, more experimental game or story. You know, one of those things that seems like it would be amazing, but deadlines and other work usually makes it a terrible idea to pursue.
* I might have a new computer.
* I take a fucking break for the first time in 15 years :p

Until the next update,
