Every single year, the same ritual repeats. The longest day of the year is behind us. Summer changes into Autumn, the days slowly grow shorter, but we still have some long and warm nights.

Until, all of a sudden, it's only 6 PM and the sun is already setting! Everyone mentions it. Some complain about it, as they expected to be able to do more that day, but it's _suddenly_ already dark. The same comments as always make the rounds: "It feels like just yesterday we could still walk outside at 8 PM. And now, in just a day or two, it's suddenly _dark_!"

Although I refrain from joining this ritual, I do _feel_ the same. Every year. As summer nears its end, you just _assume_ that days will be "a bit shorter" but "it'll still be light outside at 9 PM, right?" Then, even deep into Autumn, this feeling stays the same.

Until _boom_, skadeladoozie, it's only 6:30 and the sun already sets.

_Why_ does this keep happening? Why do we feel that way? 

Why do our bodies or minds never learn? Why is it so hard to understand that yes, if the days get _a little shorter_ every day, then at some point the days will be _much shorter than during the summer_. Why does this surprise us?

Well, because the assumption behind this **is wrong!**

Most people have the following basic understanding.

* From the longest day of the year (June 21st) to the shortest day of the year (December 21st) ...
* The sun will set a little earlier every day ...
* And this difference is, like, a few minutes (per day)

If you ask people, they can't give a precise number, but they _will_ give _a number_. Some think the sun sets 30 seconds earlier each day. Others say 5 minutes. It doesn't matter, because all of it's wrong.

Remember that the earth is round and rotates. It does so in an ellipse around the sun, yes, but that's not relevant. It also rotates on its own slanted axis, and it _tilts_ during the year. When winter approaches, the Earth is tilting _away_ from the sun. Which means we're exposed to sunlight for less time during each day, which is why the sun rises and sets earlier.

This is a gradual change _in rotation_. The position of your town, in relation to the sun, moves _over an arc_. A curve. A round path. Not a straight line.

In other words, the change in "daylight time" is **not linear**.

It's not "2 minutes every day". It's not "the sun sets 64 seconds earlier each day until it perfectly reaches the shortest day".

No, the difference in sunset time from day to day _changes_!

And now you can probably guess where this "feeling" (or "ritual") in my introduction comes from.

* The first few months, this change moves from _a few seconds_ to _a few minutes_. 
  * The second-longest day of the year is only _a few seconds_ shorter. But by the time we reach September, the sun sets earlier every day _by a few minutes_ (compared to the previous day).
* During October (roughly), the change is minimal. During just this period, the differences in sunset time are _almost_ linear. 
  * It goes from _3:30 minutes_ to its maximum of around _4 minutes_, then back to _3:30 minutes_.
* The last few months, this change moves from _a few minutes_ back to _a few seconds_.
  * So yes, just before that shortest day of the year (~just before Christmas), the days are almost all equally long. The sunset time barely changes anymore.

For the first few months, we don't "feel" the days grow shorter, because they _barely do_! Only once the end of September rolls around, has this difference (from day to day) changed from a few seconds to full minutes. And yes, then it quickly adds up, and we _suddenly_ notice it's already dark outside! And then, once we're used to that, it slows down again and the length of the days barely changes until the shortest day.

So yes, people are actually right. It does suddenly get dark very quickly. Yes, it was just yesterday that the days were long and warm. All of August and most of September there is _barely_ any change, until it suddenly adds up. 

It's actually a very acute observation that almost all humans have, but we just don't know why, and we assume we're _wrong_ because we've taught ourselves that sunset times change linearly.

Why am I telling you this?

Firstly, because you might learn a thing or two. I don't know, tell this to people at parties, use it in your next creative project, whatever. ("What if ... we had a fantasy world where the change from longest-to-shortest day of the year happened _instantly_?")

Secondly, to give a fun example that illustratues a bigger problem in how people "think". So, so often people have these ingrained assumptions. These "I was taught things worked this way as a kid" or "when I first learned about this topic, I made assumption X, so I'm sticking to that the rest of my life". Sometimes we do it consciously, sometimes it's just a subconscious habit.

But then we build our other opinions or thoughts on such assumptions. We can be convinced we are _right_, because starting with assumption X, it is absolutely logical to arrive at argument Y. It's extremely hard to change people's mind when this is the case, even if all evidence points out they are wrong in practice.

The issue isn't the chain of thought or the logical reasoning, it's the very first assumption that started the reasoning in the first place.

I think you'll find problems easier to solve and arguments easier to support once you realize this. Whenever you're stuck, go over your _input_ to your thoughts---go over your inherit assumptions and "I take this as self-evident"---and see if something fishy is going on there. 

You'll usually find something. Such as the assumption that daylight time changes linearly. Or, for example, the assumption that the sun directly heats our air. Which is not true. Sunlight heats the _earth_ (our "ground", if you want), which then emits that heat back to the air.

So much of what we're taught in school, or by parents, or learned from our own first impressions, can be wrong. In small or huge ways. When we build our other thinking on top of it, it's bound to end up in the wrong place, and we just don't know why.

Train yourself to spot this. Help others spot this too, no matter how much they may resist. Whenever someone says something wacky, just ask them how they arrived at that conclusion. Ask them about their starting assumptions. What lies at the very start of their reasoning, which they assume to be self-evident, obvious, or proven? 

It's the fastest way to spot logical errors and reach the right conclusion. Additionally, it's the nicest way of saying "you are talking bullshit right now, can you please explain yourself?" :p

But, you might say, weren't people _right_ about the sunset times? Yes! That's why it's such a good example.

I just explained how to think _logically_ and make _stronger logical arguments_. But the world isn't all logic, is it? Most _people_ wouldn't know how to form a logical argument to save their life, and those people might be very kind, or very smart, or have achieved a lot.

I've found that, if you just don't close yourself off, our human sense and intuition are great. Not infallible, of course not. Sometimes not to be trusted, such as when you're hungry, sick or sleep-deprived. Most of the time, though, when we _feel_ something is off, then it _is_. We often arrive at a _conclusion_ that is right and tangible---what our senses pick up---but then we sort of backtrack and find silly and wrong reasons to support that conclusion.

I once heard a statement about that in a talk about psychology and marketing. I've noticed it all around me ever since, and I hold it as one of the top five "Laws of Human Nature" people should know.

The statement was something like: "We think we're logical beings, but we're not. We're just monkeys. Monkeys with a slight upgrade. So we _first_ make a decision or reach a conclusion, and then _afterward_ our slow intelligent brain comes in and makes up bullshit reasons for why we did that."

It's exactly that. People _instantly_ feel or notice that the sun suddenly sets much earlier. Then, a few seconds later, their slower "deeper thought mode" arrives and comes up with all sorts of excuses and weird reasons for it. Then, to save face, we present that to our friends and family in reverse order, as if our feeling was the result of some wise deliberation :p

In other words,

* Keep your mind and body open. Trust your gut, lean on intuition, rely on your senses. They are often _right_ about the reality of things. Of course they are! Our body and brain have evolved to survive as well as possible in _reality_. Especially if you need to make snapshot decisions, this is _fine_. You don't need a reason; do what feels right.
* But catch yourself before you make up silly "arguments" and "reasons" later. Go over your assumptions, make sure they are actually valid, and then _follow the assumptions logically_. If, starting from the best possible input, you arrive at the same conclusion as your instinct, then it's a great indicator you're on the right track. If not, update your thoughts, and make a mental note to train your intuition in the right direction.

And now you can be more certain about your choices, maybe convince a few others who spout nonsense to learn logical thinking instead, or just show off your knowledge about sunset times at a party.

Those were my thoughts for today. Written after hearing that phrase "oh wow, it's _already dark_ at 6 PM! How did _that_ happen? It really feels like the sun is setting earlier each your. Could it be climate change?" for the umpteenth time.

Until the next article in my series of _Common Wrong Assumptions_, where I explain how nobody actually knows how electricity travels through a wire and we're just glad our power grids have worked out so far.

(Just kidding. Though it _is_ true.)
