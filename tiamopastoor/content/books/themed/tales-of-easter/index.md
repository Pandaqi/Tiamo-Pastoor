This is a bundle of Easter-related stories. The first few stories are an adaptation of the Biblical tale that inspired the feast. The later stories are new fairy tales showing, in a fun and magical way, how modern rituals and customs appeared. Also, a very funny and surprising version of the Easter Bunny might appear.

Each story is _short_ and written in relatively _simple language_, which means it can be read to young children, and slightly older children can read it themselves. The language used can teach them a few new words, but should otherwise be no problem. The deeper themes of Easter, however---including faith, life and death, betrayal, and more---might take younger readers several reads to grasp.

This is **not** a 100% accurate retelling of what's in the Bible. It's a loose adaptation bordering on parody. These stories are spin-off stories ("Type B") for the larger [The Saga of Life](https://thesagaoflife.com) universe, bundled because they all relate to Easter.

Why do this?

* It means they are magical adventures with a bit more action and humor.
* It means they can explore other themes, characters, and larger (historical) threads than just the narrow story (of the Passion) most people already know.
* It means they also appeal to those who don't believe or are not familiar with any of the source material. 

The entire book is **136 pages**, spread over 10 "Gospels" that go forward in time and give an explanation for how the modern Easter celebration came to be.
