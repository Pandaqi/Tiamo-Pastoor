This is a **bundle of "scary" short stories**, taking place in the fictional Tinglespine Town. 

It's meant to be a kind of "my first horror stories" for kids, and ideal for Halloween. 

* Every story is short and standalone. 
* You can read them in any order, but reading from start to finish gives you a small overarching story too. 
* The stories can be read _to your children_, or they can try and read them _on their own_. The language and concepts are simple enough for that.

As expected, there is **_no_ actual "horror"** in the stories (no violence, no gore, etc). They are a bit scary, a bit unsettling, a bit frightening. Each story focuses on a typical fear that kids (or all humans) might have, and most of them lure you into the wrong direction before revealing there was no danger after all. 

Because "fear" is subjective, though, some stories will certainly be more scary than others to a specific kid. If your child is not scared by spiders, then the story about a big spider is not a big issue. If they _are_ afraid of spiders, then the story hopefully helps them realize there's nothing to fear. There's no harm in being scared by a story, but we don't want kids staying up all night because of nightmares ;)

We hope you enjoy these silly spooky stories as much as we enjoyed writing them.

We believe there are not enough "horror/thriller stories for children". This bundle tries to change that! We don't normally write such stories, though. So if your kid enjoyed these and wants more, do not assume that all the other children's books on here are in the same genre. They will, generally, have the same kind of writing style and approach to storytelling.

The product also includes a nice "spooky melody" I came up with while writing this book. It's a simple piano recording, but it was so nice and atmospheric that I wanted to share it!
