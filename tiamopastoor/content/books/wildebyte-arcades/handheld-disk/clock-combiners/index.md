logline: |
  Wildebyte and their companions are displaced ... through time. If they want to see each other again, they must faithfully play this new game without breaking any Time Rules. But this means living their worst nightmare: allowing other entities to merge with them and meddle with their body and brain, for good and definitely for worse.

blurb: |
  Upon entering _At Your Mergy_, Wildebyte and their companions are displaced ... through time. The only way to reverse it and meet again, is by faithfully playing the game. 
  
  But that means living their worst nightmare: allowing other entities to merge with them and meddle with their code. In a literal race against time, everyone must decide what price they're willing to pay for each other.
