blurb: |
  Wildebyte enters an odd game called Cutrope. Everything is made of ropes, connected by ropes, and dangles precariously over a scary abyss. 
  
  They must figure out the Rope Laws and only cut the right wires, or the things they hold dear drop into fatal depths. A true puzzle when the rules seem random and their hands are more and more tied up.
