logline: |
  Poisongold is made of nothing but magical water. The game never explains this to the Player controlling Wildebyte, though. As poisonous currents tug on them and threaten eternal agony, they must teach the player a puzzle that doesn't care to explain itself.

blurb: |
  The game Poisongold has water everywhere. Not a solid piece of land in sight. As the puzzles get harder, though, the water mixes with more cursed fluids that cause intense pain that will never end. 
  
  But the game never explains this to Wildebyte---or to the player. They must figure out how to teach a game that doesn't care to explain itself, while dragged away by the never-ending current and risking being poisoned.
