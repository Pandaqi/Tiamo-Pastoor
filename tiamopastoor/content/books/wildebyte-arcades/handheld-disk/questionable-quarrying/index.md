blurb: |
  Wildebyte enters an empty and unresponsive game. It must still be fully explored, but it's rumored to contain some legendary artefacts. When they discover that their real body is withering, the Scattered Lifestones must be found. 
  
  All scouts they sent out, however, return with positive but cryptic messages. They must decide which path to follow, and which is a literal dead end.
