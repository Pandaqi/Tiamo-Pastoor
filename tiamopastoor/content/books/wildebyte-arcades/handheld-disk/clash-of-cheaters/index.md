logline: |
  Wildebyte enters a game of unconventional warfare between interesting tribes. But not everyone is playing by the rules, performing unfair attacks that shouldn't be possible, which threatens to destroy the game and real lives.

blurb: |
  The Taceheart Tribe destroys all their opponents and the game, doing things that shouldn't be possible. Elephants are used as cannonballs, candy canes as spears, and buildings teleported. When Wildebyte lands in the middle of it, they must figure out their tricks and defend against them before it's too late, all while mysterious beings are trying to catch Wildebyte specifically.
