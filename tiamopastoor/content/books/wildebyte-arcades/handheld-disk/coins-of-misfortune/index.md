blurb: |
  Ludra runs on money, and Wildebyte finally has enough to buy their help in escaping back to their real life. Until everyone's money is swallowed by the Crackler of Coins and his empire of dice, card and other lucky games. 
  
  Wildebyte must visit his lair and stop everyone from self-destructing Ludra, but their foe is clever and tempts them with endless riches if he does none of that. Quite the opposite, in fact.
