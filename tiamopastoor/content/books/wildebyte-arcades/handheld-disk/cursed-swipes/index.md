logline: |
  Wildebyte returns to a familiar game, but finds it broken. Nobody has limbs, cats fall from the sky, and everyone is angry for mysterious reasons. They discover a special Ludramagic to fix the game---and see their future. As their nightmare becomes truth, however, they are forced to use this magic no matter the personal cost.

blurb: |
  The game Frustrated Pigeons is not how Wildebyte remembers it. It's barely played. It's another bad clone by the Guild. Nobody has limbs, cats fall from the sky, and everyone is angry for mysterious reasons.
  
  As they investigate the reason, hopping from planet to planet, they stumble upon a special type of Ludramagic. One that allows certainty of the future---but also comes at a great cost. When their biggest nightmare suddenly becomes reality, Wildebyte must fix the game's flaws while at their weakest, swimming in unknown seas.
