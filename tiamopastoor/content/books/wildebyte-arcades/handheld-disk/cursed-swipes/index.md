logline: |
  Wildebyte returns to a familiar game, but finds it broken. It's empty, bad, barely fun. They discover a mystery and a special Ludramagic that might fix the game's flaws. As his nightmare becomes truth, however, they might be forced to use this magic no matter the cost.

blurb: |
  The game Frustrated Pigeons is not how Wildebyte remembers it. It's worse. It's barely played. As they investigate the reason, they stumble upon a special type of Ludramagic that comes at a great cost. Mastery means enormous power, failure means a devastating curse. 
  
  When their biggest nightmare suddenly becomes reality, Wildebyte must fix the game's flaws while at their weakest, swimming in unknown seas.
