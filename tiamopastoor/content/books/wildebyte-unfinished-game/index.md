  You are promised something incredible: be a character inside a video game. But only in exchange for completing a mission: Break into the Data Vault.

This is the first book of the Wildebyte Arcades. It also has the honor of being my first internationally published novel (written in English).

You can probably guess how the idea started. At the end of the year 2022, as I _tried_ to force myself to take a Christmas break, I looked back on what I'd achieved that year. I had written many books. I had created many games.

Something clicked in my brain. Why not write a series about someone stuck in games?

The next few days, as new year's eve approached, I could think of almost nothing else. By the time 2023 started, I already had a large document with ideas, possible games to clone, general lore, and more. In fact, I wrote the first few chapters of this first book in the first week of January.

Those chapters are nowhere to be found now, though. Because I realized I jumped in too fast and needed more time to flesh out the world and what I was actually going for. I left the book alone for half a year, only gathering ideas for now. At the time, two different ideas for episodic stories were fighting each other. I didn't know which one to go for, and doing both seemed a bad idea. 

Then, in 9 days, I wrote this first book from scratch. And the second and third Wildebyte book right after it. (Not during those same 9 days, obviously. Also don't forget edits and revisions---they always take longer than you expected or wanted.)

Well, we'd found a clear winner. The Wildebyte Arcades would be my next big series for at least a few years!

The series hopefully provides ...
* Relatively short books that are easy to read for all ages, but especially children.
* With unique, light-hearted adventures that blend fantasy and sci-fi
* Grounded in actual real knowledge of game development and how computers work, which means it also _teaches_ some of it with every book.
* But still more layers and more complexity behind the storylines, as I just can't help it. (I started the first book telling myself "just a fun adventure with no meaning!" and it ended up being this exploration of _free will_ somehow.)

As always, way more information and details can be found in the diaries for these books.
