This bundle contains **a collection of related short stories** (fairy tales the length of book chapters) about **basic colors and emotions**. Each story focuses on one specific color, sneakily introducing many situations where it occurs, and telling a tale around the emotions commonly associated with that color. 

* The stories can be read standalone, but it's highly recommended to just read them in order and see **the bigger story**!
* It can be read **to** children aged 4/5 to explore basic colors and emotions.
* It can also be read **by** older children who can appreciate the deeper meanings and context.

All these stories take place in Rainbow World, which is infused with a strange magic. The land is _painted_ by your emotions. Angry? Your home is suddenly red. Sad? The baguette in your hand is suddenly blue. 

At first, you might think this is fun and joyful. But there's a catch. The colors need to stay balanced. We need _all_ the colors, not just one or two. If the land ever contains creatures that _all_ have the same emotion ... all color is lost forever and we enter Endless Blackness.

And let's just say that our story starts off with the world being _very close_ to this disaster.

These stories are a mixture between fun magic and action, as explained, but also much deeper meaning and lessons. That's why it has a somewhat lofty title for a children's book, and that's why we really recommend taking the time to read the whole thing and talk about its themes and messages. There are no _literally_ colorblind characters in this story, but _figuratively_ speaking ...
