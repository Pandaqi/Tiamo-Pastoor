Comm Pear is a cute father pear who is about to have a baby pear. He wants to give his child the _best_ possible home when they're born! And so he starts traveling around. He finds a house near the water, a cradle in the desert, a hut in the jungle, and many more places. 

But wherever he looks ... he is never satisfied. The grass is always greener on the other side. He can always see a place in the distance that looks even _better_. Will Comm Pear ever find the perfect cradle? Or will he get stuck comparing places forever?

This story is split into **10 chapters**. Each chapter is written to be as standalone as possible, so you can read _one short chapter_ to your Apprentice(s) at a time. You can see it as many short stories combined into one bundle. Also, to make it sound more fun and make it easier to understand/remember, the text is almost entirely written in **rhyme**.

As expected, the stories explore the idea of _comparing_ in a fun way. Our fruity hero keeps comparing different parts of the world around him, trying to find that perfect home. More space is better, right? A softer bed is better than a hard bed, right? 

Will he find the perfect cradle? Read and find out :)

{{% remark %}}
These stories are _not_ about "opposites" (hot/cold, day/night, big/small, etc) It is, rather, a sort of prelude to that. It merely introduces _comparing_ things on some scale like "size". The concept of Opposites is notorious for confusing some kids for years and years, which is why we left it out of Level 1. We intend to write a different Explorer bundle about Opposites at Level 2 of this store!
