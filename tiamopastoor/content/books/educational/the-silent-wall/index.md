This bundle contains **magical fairy tales**. They are meant to be read by the Guardian to the Apprentices (most likely young children).

Six short stories tell about a curious object called The Silent Wall. An object that has separated the people in these lands, and made it impossible to communicate or understand each other.

It's a physical metaphor for the concept of language being this big, complicated, tough concept. But you can understand it easily by seeing that it's built out of smaller bricks (such as letters, syllables, words). In every story, the magical wall crumbles down a bit further ... and children learn what the new smallest bricks are made of.

A fun, simple story that provides a solid intuition for learning the details later.

It's also why this resource is marked as an option in almost all Level 1 Language Resources. Don't feel the need to read all short stories in one go.

This is also the first book where we added an additional file with **bingo cards**! A simple way to check comprehension of the story, as well as make it a little more interactive and allow listeners to fiddle with something. We've never seen it done before, but it seemed such a great idea to us that we had to try. Being a first attempt, we're not sure if we approached it right, so let us know what you thought.
