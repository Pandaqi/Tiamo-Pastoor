This is a fairy tale about the time when **aliens landed in the fairy tale forest**. They spoke a different language, which made it hard to understand them. Fortunately, there was one animal who claimed to be a "translator". They could translate between the languages and make us understand what the aliens wanted and why they were destroying our things. Until someone figures out that their so-called _translation_ ... might just be a trick with phonemes.

The story is split into **5 short chapters**. Each chapter is written to be as self-contained as possible, so you can read _one short chapter_ to your Apprentice(s) at a time. But it's really one continuous story referencing previous chapters, not five completely separate stories.

These stories are definitely meant to be read out loud. They are about _phonemes_, after all, which are the sounds that make up words. The final step before Apprentices are ready for the alphabet. This "Translator" applies a trick every time to make it sound like he's speaking a new language, but in reality, he's just swapping one phoneme for another ...

A fun way to discover and explore the concept!

{{% remark %}}
Yes, the actual spelling of the word is _tricksy_ or _tricky_. We spelled it wrong on purpose because this is a story about _phonemes_, and how different letters can still create the same sounds when spoken. Also because we really like unique memorable titles that are easily searched, which work better in practice. It's annoying these days how often search engines (e.g. Google) just change your input to something else entirely that they believe you wanted to search instead, giving vague results.
