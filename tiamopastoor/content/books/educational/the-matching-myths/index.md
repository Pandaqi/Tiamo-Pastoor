The fairy tales included in this resource are meant to be read to young children. As expected, they are short (at most ~1,000 words) and mixed with pictures. 

They are also intended to be quite interactive. After reading a short section, there will usually be a picture and the child has the chance to recognize/pick out the element that does or doesn't match. 

For example, _The Twin Tigers_ is about finding a magical tiger toy that's identical to another (to lift a curse). The pictures show people who try to _trick_ you by showing a toy that _almost_ looks the same ... but something is different.

This book contains a lot of high-resolution images. That's why it's a large file to download, especially considering books are usually tiny downloads. We also supply these images on their own (instead of baked into the book) to make sure you can use them however you want.

Some of the illustrations were made using AI. In the future we hope to do a refresh with manually drawn images, once resources allow, though that will likely mean a price increase.
