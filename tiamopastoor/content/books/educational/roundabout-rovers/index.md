The _Roundabout Rovers_ are bad pirates. So bad you can barely call them pirates. Their ship _can't move_ and they keep confusing each other with Pirate-speak. Until, one day, someone discovers how to unlock another direction. And another.

Follow them through **10 short stories** (or "chapters"), where each one unlocks a new direction that they immediately try to use to find a treasure. The stories are short and simple and can be read standalone, but reading the whole thing (in order) gives you a bigger overarching story.

It teaches the common (and pretty essential) words for indicating direction and location. By using them in a fun story, and giving them context, Apprentices are more likely to understand and remember. As with all stories in Level 1, it is supposed to be read _to_ children.

This can be read as an **interactive story**! Every story has an **image** of a treasure map, and the chapter itself gives clues about the next location they should (or can) go. See the images for some examples of what this interactivity looks like. There are also a few chapters near the end with a zoomed-in version of the map for a different kind of (direction-based) puzzle.

As always, we tried our best to make the images as simple as possible to make sure they work in all ereaders, PDF readers and printers. For example, you _don't_ need color for this book to work. But we can't guarantee that all the images will look exactly as we intended on your specific device. This is why we included all the images as separate files too.
