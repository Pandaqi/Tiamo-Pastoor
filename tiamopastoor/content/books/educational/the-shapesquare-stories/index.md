This bundle contains a **collection of related short stories** (fairy tales the length of book chapters) focused on the topic of **basic shapes**. 

In Shapesong, King Triangle has suddenly declared that everything and everyone should be a Triangle! Many shapes try to comply, for they don't want to break the law and be punished. But the more they try to create triangular soccer fields, and triangular homes, or even triangular heads ... the more they realize this isn't a great plan. And what's up with those mysterious shapes cut out of the environment? Might those ancient stones be the answer? 

Follow a diverse set of Rebelshapes on a shape-related adventure as they try to battle the evil King Triangle!

Enjoyed these adventures and want more? No worries! Our shape-related games regularly include King Triangle or the Rebelshapes (animals shaped suspiciously like a basic shape) in the rules and material! Check the "Continue Exploring" section in this topic.

You might also want to check out [Chronicles of the Colorblind](/books/educational/chronicles-of-the-colorblind/). It's the same idea, but exploring one basic _color_ per story. That one has slightly longer stories and more grown-up themes (about emotion and making mistakes); the Shapesquare Stories sticks a bit more to whimsical stories suitable to very young ages.

A very young version of our magical easter bunny, called _Astra Buni_, also appears here. You can find more from her in our [Tales of Easter](/books/themed/tales-of-easter/) bundle.
