This is a **collection of short stories** (fairy tales the length of typical book chapters) about ... where stories come from and how they work. Hence, pre-story. 

The story starts with very early humans, living in a cave and barely being able to communicate. A mysterious, scary danger is coming. But how does our hero inform the others? How can he warn them in time? Stubborn as humans are, they don't listen when he simply _tells_ them to run away. And so he starts inventing a bit of a story around it ...

These stories stand on their own and can be read to/by very young Apprentices without taking too long. But if you read them all, in order, you follow our heroes as they discover the power of stories and how to use them for _good_. Story by story, they discover _why_ we tell them, and how to tell them _most effectively_. How stories can save lives, change hearts, or simply teach---far more effectively than many other means.

It's a great setup for kids to start writing their own stories or read longer/more complicated books later.

**This bundle was inspired by the Tales of 1001 Nights.** Many stories are simplified, kid-friendly, more magical versions of its best tales. The Book Worm who narrates it all is basically the same "framing device" as used in that classic masterpiece. We took the fun ideas of flying carpets and mischievous genies and basically asked ourselves: "what if this was just a regular part of how your world worked?" If any of these stories resonated with you, you might try reading the vast library of tales in the original. But be warned: the original _1001 Nights_ stories are considerably more gruesome and ... adult-ish.
