_Astra Buni_ is a recurring character in our story universe and our magical interpretation of the Easter bunny. This book is basically her "origin story", as it finally completely focuses on her and how she ended up with her magical powers.

What are her powers? Well, you'll need to read the story for details. But suffice it to say that she has a magical paintbrush that casts spells if she manages to draw the right things. As the story continues, she tries different lines, different shapes, more complicated drawings, as she slowly discovers how to cast the spell she wants. Instead of accidentally making everything float again.

This is a **bundle of 10 short stories** (or "chapters"). If you read them all, in order, you get a bigger story. But each individual story is standalone and short, which allows reading just one of them before bedtime, for example. Most chapters have Astra try something new, or tackle a new problem, and discover a new fact about her magic.

As expected, the stories teach about **pencil control**. They encourage Apprentices to start creating their own drawings, copy what Astra is doing, maybe invent their own written "spells". All of this is great practice for fine motor skills and great preparation for handwriting later.

As can be seen in the marketing images, every chapter starts with an image of the new type of line/shape/spell that will appear. These were kept simple and in the right format to make sure they display properly on both ereaders and when printed. Because, to put it mildly, ereaders and printers tend to heavily disagree about how to display images properly ;)
