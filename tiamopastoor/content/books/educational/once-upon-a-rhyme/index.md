This book is about two magical kingdoms that _rhymed_ with each other. In the _literal_ sense, yes, because the story is written like a poem. But also in the _figurative_ sense: the kingdoms are identical ... until you look more closely and see that, in the end, they differ in important ways.

As expected, the story showcases rhyming, which is a great way for children to understand word sounds and play around with them. It also showcases some other language playfulness (such as alliteration). There's even a recurring mystery that you can solve just by rhyming or not rhyming ...

At such a young age, perhaps before they learn the alphabet, that's really the only goal: get them interested and playing around with language.

The book contains several short chapters, to make it ideal for reading to children (without taking too long). The chapters are mostly standalone, but it's really meant as one connected story to read from start to finish. On their own, many events don't mean much, and you will surely miss the deeper theme.
