**Quest for a Home** is part 1 of the book series **The Tale of Tiny Blades**. It shows Arthur as a very young boy, at the start of his journey to become the legendary king we all know and love.

* It contains **24 chapters** of about **1,000 words each**. You can (for example) read one chapter a day to your children or to your class. Or let children try and read it themselves (if their ability allows). The chapters take about 10 minutes to read out loud at a casual pace.
* Each chapter is written as a **self-contained story**. It reminds you of what happened last time. It explains difficult words in a fun way. It shows one new lesson from Merlin. That said, it is a _book_ (not a story bundle), which means there's an overarching plot and it's best read in order.
* The book is written in our trademark style. **Language is simple and sentences are short.** It contains a lot of whimsy and **humor**. But this simple and playful approach allows it to show core themes of the Arthurian Legends (honor, knights, kingdoms) and be somewhat historically accurate. 

As we always say: _"Kids can handle deeper themes and serious events---they just don't know a lot of words yet."_ 

We are very proud of this set of stories. We hope they bring educational value (in teaching about the historic events that led to the Arthurian Legends) as well as exciting and emotional stories (about what it means to be honorable and a good man/king).
