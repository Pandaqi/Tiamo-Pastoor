Want to get in touch? Well, how you do that depends a little on _why_ you want to get in touch.

## Email

Whenever in doubt, your best bet is to **mail me**! To keep things simple, I collect everything on my main work email:

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em;">
    <a href="mailto:tiamo@rodepanda.com">tiamo@rodepanda.com</a>
</p>

## Feedback / Reviews

If you want to leave feedback or a review, you can usually do that wherever you _bought_ the book!

Don't be afraid, don't hold in. Leave honest reviews to help other buyers. Leave honest feedback for _me_ to learn and improve.

Over the years, I've been stunned by how _many_ people lie because they're afraid to hurt feelings, and how _few_ people contact me after enjoying a project of mine! Don't be like them!

## Collaboration / Hiring

I am licensed as a freelance artist (based in the Netherlands). If you want to hire me for a project, or collaborate on something, visit my [portfolio](https://rodepanda.com)

My other areas of expertise are **programming** (mostly games and websites), **music** (mostly composing and writing), and **design** (mostly graphics and stylized).

## Social Channels

I am present on several other (social) channels, which usually support leaving a comment or sending a direct message. I will read those, but it might take a while, and it's not my favorite method.

When it comes to writing, for example, one of the main websites for discussion and reviews is [GoodReads](https://goodreads.com).

Similarly, my old Dutch blog is still online at [Niet Dat Het Uitmaakt](https://nietdathetuitmaakt.nl). It runs on WordPress, which means you can leave comments and I'll get notified!
