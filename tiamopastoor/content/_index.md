Hi, I'm **Tiamo Pastoor**! Welcome to my author website. Here you can find everything related to my [books](/books/) and work as a [writer](/info/about/). 

I mostly write **fantasy** for **younger audiences**. I, however, like to experiment. One day I might release a detective for adults, the other I might release a romantic fantasy for middle-grade, and before you know it I released a non-fiction book.

Scroll down to see my latest and upcoming **books**. Or my latest ramblings about everything and nothing on the **blog**.

_My oldest work is all in Dutch. I switched to writing English fiction in 2023._
