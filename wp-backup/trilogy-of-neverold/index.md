**Trilogy of Neverold** is a series of fantasy novels, mostly aimed at children and young adults. The stories are standalone, allowing you to read them in any order, or only one of them. But if you take the time to read them all (in order), a bigger story emerges that takes place in the same world ...

These stories started life, many years ago, as _Dutch musicals_: "Kapers van de Eenzame Kust", "Brieven aan Breekbaard", en "De Vogel van Zand". In the Netherlands, we have a tradition called the "farewell musical". Children graduating from elementary school to high school play a musical together at the end of the school year. To say "farewell" to their first school. 

I wrote these musicals originally for that specific occassion: to give teachers something fun and professional to play with their class. 

**Are you a teacher/student and interested in playing one of these musicals?** Send me an email! We'll work out the details. The music and scripts for all musicals are basically _done_, but I'm not opposed to tweaking, changing or adding parts to fit your requirements.

Because I'd still love to produce these one day. But musicals are generally hard to sell (or produce on your own), which is why I decided to convert them into fantasy novels.
