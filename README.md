# Tiamo Pastoor

This is the full source code / project behind [Tiamo Pastoor (my author website)](https://tiamopastoor.com).

It's made using Hugo, which means it's a static website that I can generate and upload once in a while.

The actual website is inside `tiamopastoor`, everything else is metadata or supportive documents for the project.

The website basically has three parts: `blog` (which mostly contains my old Dutch blog for now), `books` (the books I wrote and upcoming ones), `diary` (the diaries I keep while writing a story.) 

Nothing is hidden or changed for this public version. If you don't want spoilers for upcoming books or projects, don't dive too deep ;)

I'm open sourcing all my websites in an effort towards an open world based on sharing and transparency. It's the least I can do.
